1,examination pattern is good
1,"Exam pattern is up to the mark and the Cgpa depends on the various marks distributions like ca, mte etc which is very nice as compare to other institutions. Paper checking does not depend on length of ques but on the material which is the best part of it."

1,It is statisfactory.

1,GOOD AND STRICT
-1,not much good
0,exams conducting is very good .but paper correction is very bad
0,The examination pattern is good. More of logic based and subjective questions to be asked which is based upon conceptual learning. Paper checking must be done in a more lucid manner because many doubts arise with the checking of OMR sheet.
1,all these are good
1,the best pattern of examination are in lpu .
0,mid term percentage should be increased so that students get more choice to get success in the examinations
1,The examination system of the university is very impressive. The sitting plan of he students is made in such a way that no 2 students of same class give the exam in same room or even sometimes same blocks. Through this students also get to know and visit different blocks of the university. The checking is also fair .
1,Everything is pretty well organised
1,very good 5/5
-1,for some subjects like maths and english (passage writing) the time duration needs to increase
0,"Pattern is good ...marks distribution that includes ca, mt, et , and attendence all that is little complicated"

1,"I have never seen this type of examination,,,,,,,very GOOD pattern"
-1,"examination checking sucks here , don't know why I get low marks even if 4 qustions are wrong . answer key of exam is absurd, discrepancy system is not advantageous, answers of exam not right, omr should be uploaded"
1,It is best
-1,"examination pattern is good but, there is blunder mistake.that is we ha no alternate to check the mistake where we have done morever no question papers also not given for discussion. so i suggest to.. provide option for checking mistakes in the MCQ exams such as midterm."
-1,time not sufficient
1,exam pattern is good
0,everything is excellent but paper checking is not good
-1,We don't get answers key and even the question papers for our mcq exams. There should be some means by which we could recheck our answers and get to know what mistakes we have made.
0,exam pattern is very nice but paper checking is not at all good .
0,Exam pattern and marks distribution are excellent but sometimes there are some errors in paper checking.
0,exam pattern is very good but if you give question papers to students it is helpful
1,"Exam pattern Very good, Marks distribution good but sometimes disappointing, paper checking OK"
1,yeah it's obviously good
1,exam pattern is completely different the entire exams are objective oriented resumbling the education in abroad my review is 5/5
1,everything was good.

1,"Excellent exam pattern, paper checking in this university is easy"

-1,Lab and practical are not upto the mark. The topic which are practiced are almost already done in Btech.
-1,Not up to the mark
-1,lab improves practical knowledge
0,Sometimes systems at labs are screwed up .Otherwise everything is at their respected desk.
1,Practical work is fair
1,Practical and easy learning
-1,"The evaluation is again bad for our CA, as one of our faculty is really weird. He gives us remarks on the basis of how we present things in front of it, he never look for the content of our answer, which is really annoying. As he expects us to deliver answer in the way he wants us to do. But how can a person do that, as people do have different mentality and they do explain themselves in different manner, so a teacher must understand that quality of a child and should give him marks on the basis of what they say not what they should say."

1,IT IS THE BEST THING IN THIS UNIVERSITY I LIKE IT
-1,"His notes are terrible and useless. To make matters worse, the textbook he uses is also garbage. Don't take this course if you like to learn on your own."
1,It was his first time teaching this course so he was very careful in teaching it. He was ALWAYS ready to help. Puts a lot of effort into his presentations and tries to help out in any way possible. Very clear. Tries to make the course interesting by giving real life examples and telling stories and taking everything to a higher level. Good prof!
1,Challenging. Exam was fair. Interesting material. I learned a lot.
-1,No Comments
-1,Snooze fest.
0,Tests fairly but teaches way beyond the students' level
0,"Seems like an incredibly great guy and delivers a lot of passion to the lecture hall. That said, he does not prepare well for class, is often late and stumbles over his explanations. Could do with a lot more rehearsal."
-1,"Hard to understand. Says stuff like, ""how the step is gonna look like?"" I think he means, ""what is the next step?"" but it's hard to tell. Lecture slides are half written and inherited from another prof. Nice guy, pretty funny and also helpful if you talk to him. The lectures would be better if he wrote his own notes, or just wrote on the board."
-1,"Material is easy. I can't understand anything he says, so there is no point to attending his lectures if the 3% iClicker marks aren't important to you. Not to say he's not a good guy. He's pretty awesome."
0,Needs a while to get used to his accent.
-1,Useful material but very likely to lower your GPA. I would not take this class unless you need it for something specific.
1,Best professor.
1,"Amazing prof! Knows what he's talking about, negotiable and approachable in office hours, and once you get past the accent, will explain anything you ask well and passionately. Definitely taking another course with him."
-1,"his lectures are incomprehensible (even excusing his accent). He mutters, jumps around the topics, never fully explains a concept. GET THE TEXTBOOK or you'll likely fail (unless you already know the course material right down to the core)"
-1,always LATE! not to mention on the day of the final.
-1,"I agree with everyone else, this guy is just aweful. Worst prof I have ever had. All he does is mumble some disorganized examples that aren't even his, just a hodge podge of crap from other profs. It actually makes me angry that my money pays this guy's salary. If you can avoid him (I couldn't!) run like hell."
-1,"He is a prof from hell. Consider yourself comitting suicide as you register under his class. He is not only bad at explaining, he makes students' lives horrible. His midterms look easy, but because his classes are so confusing I never get good grades in them. I am absolutely frustrated with his class. Run away from him while you can, seriously"

0,A teacher who really enjoys what he does he lives and breathes math a little confusing at times.
1,"The best Professor EVER! Very helpful, big heart, knows her stuff! I highly recommend her clas"
1,"The best teacher. Nice, understandable,HUMAN,very helpful...just Amazing. God Bless her"
1,"This teacher is a delight. super easy I just love her I took two CD classes with her. very friendly simple and effective way of teaching, I give her A+++"
1,"Appearance (Hot meaning very professional looking and clean). One of the best CD teachers in this Dept. She's positive, knows her stuff, fair, respectful, and compassionate."
1,He is one of the best teacher I have ever had. His contents is very clear. I have understood the formula in maths more with him than the other teachers. He is an A professor
-1,"The worst, don't take him. He was a last minute professor for us. He lectures too fast and when you tell him to slow down, he doesn't. I might as well have taught myself at home."
0,"There were only 4 tests and a homework assignment due at the end of the semester, so make it count. The Final and 2 tests were onlineopen book."
-1,The 1st lectures and test were very clear; easy to understand. The following lectures and tests were the exact opposite. I am beyond lost and confused and the class avg on the 2nd test was a 45.
-1,Only grades are quizzes so making sure you do good on those are a must. He is very hard to understand and does not make much sense sometimes. The final paper is difficult as well.
0,"The lecturer is a pretty nice guy. You are only graded on a few tests which are all extended response questions, but as long as you read the material and pay decent attention in class you should honestly be fine. I actually think he was a pretty generous grader and often gave partial credit points to give you credit where credit was due."
-1,"The lecturer gave very matter-of-fact and condescending responses to simple questions about the reading or questions on the final paper. As a class, it was fairly easy but hard at times, the actual classes however are very mundane and if you don't read, you will be very confused. There is no PowerPoint, no assignments just exams."
-1,"The lecturer was not very accessible for help outside of class. He was not very understanding. In a philosophy class, you are supposed to discuss ideas and opinions, but whenever you said something he didn't agree with, he wasn't very professional in addressing it. He made students feel stupid and would always say ""We went over this."""
-1,"Incredibly demeaning and patronizing no matter what your answer is, refuses to explain what assignments are or what we are covering, simply brushing it away with ""we went over it earlier"". I have not learned an ounce of information from this class, despite the various readings and explanations."
-1,The WORST experience I have ever had at JCU. He is the least professional professor and person I have ever encountered. Ironic that he teaches on ethics yet grades on personal matters. If you do not agree with him or call him out he will sabotage your grades. Avoid at all costs!!! He is a tenured professor so he thinks he can do whatever he wants.
-1,"The lecturer is a nice guy but the class is incredibly vague, just in general. No notes, powerpoints, etc. Hardly any explanations of expectations. Would avoid if possible."
-1,"He wasn't always clear when explaining or answering questions. Must read so you can participate in class lectures. He asks ""are we getting this"" and when we don't understand he doesn't always explain effectively. 4 quizzes (10pts), 1 final paper, midterm, & final."
0,"Lectures are dry, but write down everything he writes on the board. Articles are hard to interpret, so just memorize what he says they mean. Not many grades outside of exams - which are all extended response."
0,AN extremely hard class but find a friend who's good at philosophy then you're fine. Dr. Nlandu has a solid sense of humor but is so intimidating it makes me wanna cry.
1,"The class is extremely interesting if you are into Philosophy. He's a good teacher but answers questions with questions like a stereotypical philosopher. You need to read, it's all you do in the class"
1,"One of the most interesting, thought provoking classes I've ever taken. Dr. Nlandu works with students in a conversation based format to ensure that they understand the information. If you show effort he'll give you extra help and the occasional pity point."
-1,"He's a great guy, but his lectures are hard to follow. He will ask ""Are we getting this?"" multiple times a class, and the answer is always no. But take good notes and write down everything on review days, and you'll do fine. You don't HAVE to go to class, but you better have a friend who will share their notes if you do decide to skip."
0,"He can be a bit frustrating at times, esp. when it comes to his views on religion, but he is an overall nice guy who has a secret yearning to know that you are learning from him. He clearly is a heavy thinker, so don't give stupid, thoughtless answers, or you're going to pay (you WILL look like a fool at class end)."
-1,He is extremely hard to understand. His tests are very difficult and he is not helpful at all. I do not recommend this class or professor!
-1,"After completing this course, I can honestly say it was one of the worst that I have ever taken at JCU. I read for class and tried my best to understand the material, but the way he words tests make them so much harder than they should be. Good luck if he learns your name, he will ALWAYS call on you (I know from experience). Avoid him at all costs"
-1,Worst class I have ever taken. The lectures make zero sense and he is very unwilling to explain or answer questions in class. He actually is rude if you don't understand. I also went to his office hours often and he was very rude then too- he acted as if I was wasting his time and sat there and read his mail. Tests are impossible.
-1,"Doesn't teach at all. you can't ask questions because he will say ""you should know that, you read it."" 6 tests during the semester and 1 research paper. Avoid this class at all costs."
-1,I would not recommend him for FYS. He is not clear at all and his class didn't really make any sense. you could pull off an A if you really tried. If you don't give him exactly what HE wants in a paper or on the tests then its wrong. there are 3 tests and 3 group papers. the final is a paper done by yourself
0,"He is a pretty hard grader, although he sometimes grades students based on effort, which is helpful. If you seek him out after class and ask him to clarify material he is VERY helpful. It is a hard class. If you're not willing to put in the work, then don't take Nlandu."
1,"She was one of my favorite professors. I took her classes at Umass Lowell and she helped me through so much whether it be the language or culture aspect. As long as you invest in her class and show up prepared, you will succeed because she truly will do anything to make sure you do."
1,Cares about her stets. Will not move on untill everyone in the class understands. Goes through the text page by page. Lots of prep & practice before exams. Always available for extra help. Will give extra credit.
1,she was very nice person and a good teacher!
1,I took two classes with this teacher and loved her!she was very good and explained things well. quizzes and exams were fair. I loved her Italian classes
-1,"Can I say Freaking PSYCHO, I'm Italian, and could not tolerate the way she taught the language, Wish I had gotten my money back for this class, What a waste clearly very un-professional, appears to be decent at first but when it comes to problems your having in the class she clearly could care less!"
1,i absolutely loved giulia po! she's the nicest person and a really great teacher. she calls on everyone a lot so she really engages the class and you get a lot of practice speaking. and the class is not hard at all if u put some effort in.
-1,"why is she teaching, yuk, take someone else!"
-1,"Expects way too much for a basic 101 class, and has no respect for the english in her class, if you fail to take down everything she says in italian you are on her hit list...memo note knows her own language well, but does not know how to teach it."
1,"enjoys teaching, does good job, very helpful, cute"
1,"She is a good professor, though she gives a ton of hw, but if you do it, you do learn the language.She gives quizzes and exams which are fair, if you study you will do good.She calls on you in class in order to practice the language.gets upset if you dont"
-1,She is not a 5 star prof. Course not challenging and I learned literally nothing. She plays favorites and is not as nice as other reviews indicate. I found course extremely disappointing. I would stay away from this class.
1,"I took the professor's Po 110Q class and this class was really interesting. I really felt that she has a passion for her work. She is really energetic and enthusiastic. When I asked her questions, she always gave me interesting answers and I felt like she really cared about students. I highly recommend taking her class, you won't regret!"
1,Professor is so caring and replies to emails in a timely manner. She gives insightful comments to every little assignment you submit! I would say that the readings a bit heavy for a 3 unit course but overall very interesting. 10/10 recommend!
1,"Professor is extremely interactive. She read our journal entries before class and incorporated them into her lecture slides. She invites you to articulate the motivations behind different events in history, and isn't afraid to contradict you. Assigns a decent amount of topical readings. I wish she had given more of her takes on the writings."
1,Great professor. Very caring and always engaging.
1,"Great professor!! She is quite engaging, and I received great overview of Asian history!"
1,Great Professor. Best office hour I had in Berkeley.
1,"She was an incredible prof for this course. The tests and exam are tricky, but she's very clear in what she expects and what kind of material will be on them."
1,"She is really helpful. You just need to let her know that you're having trouble. Prepare for lot of assignment/quizzes. However, she will tell about them in first class."
1,She is a nice guy! Final is hard but she curves I estimate I get 80(original) but I get 90(based on the letter grade). She is a great prof.
1,Very good prof - so nice. She cares about how we were doing and adjusted testing based on that. Very good teaching as well.
1,She is a great professor. She replied emails quickly and is always willing to help. She is caring and thoughtful.
1,"She says that if you understand the examples from class that you will do very well on exams, and she is not kidding. Exams were very representative of the course material. She was always available through email and never made you feel stupid. Didn't give answers for the textbooks questions though, which never makes sense to me."
1,Professor is a really great professor. Professor Yang is very fast at replying to emails and is always willing to help. The lecture notes were really well written with lots of examples which I found helpful. All test questions were really fair and representative of the course content.
1,Examples were explained very clearly and useful to study off of for exams. I found her exams to be very straightforward with no surprises.
1,"(STAT 3400) From F to re-taking and getting an A, contrary to others, Po genuinely cares about helping her students succeed."
1,"Her lectures were very boring, mostly because the material being taught was not the most exciting. She doesn't really try to make the lectures exciting, but she does teach well if you can force yourself to stay awake and focus."
-1,Very inconsiderate of student who take multiple courses. Formula sheets for both midterm and final were mediocre. You have to memorize a lot of formulas. Doing undergrad with a bad professor is just the worst thing ever. Professors need to understand students are taking other courses as well. There is no need to for being too harsh on exams.
1,"Don't know why the rating for her is so low, she is actually one of the best statistic professors in the faculty, she cares about students and replies emails very fast. She does have an accent, but she also understands the materials thoroughly. And her notes are also very organized and easy to understand."
1,"The materials in STAT 3400 is difficult, but Po makes it easy to understand as she teaches how to get the solution step-by-step which is very helpful."
0,"Yes her accent is hard to understand but she posts all her notes online, read over those quickly and you won't have an issue. It's a little more work for you but overall she's not a bad prof just hard to understand."
-1,"Horrible prof. Gets confused by her own notes, explains things in the most complicated way possible, and teaches material on the assignments the day they are due. Accent is hard to understand, and is very unhelpful with questions. If you must take this course, find another teacher or use the stats help center!"
-1,Had to struggle very hard with her accent. Explanations are not at all clear and it seems as though shes explaining something memorized before class with no particular order. Presents complex iclicker questions first and then explains the concept after.
-1,Useless. Got lost in her own bad notes and had on occasion switched between English and Chinese mid-sentence.
-1,Very strong Chinese accent and poor teaching quality. I followed the way which this teacher taught to solve the problem but I got lots of wrong answer in my final exam.
-1,"Nice professor but barely comprehensible, you have to be really attentive. Exam is out of her control because it is set by the department."
-1,nice prof
-1,"OK, this was tough. It's not so much that the material is hard, but he is nitpicky. Like he'll knock off half your points for mislabeling something even if the rest was ok. He also included a question on each test that no one could answer (he even pointed that out when he gave tests back). The book we used was very inconsistent with lots of errors."
-1,HARD!! FOB!!!!!!!
1,assignments are key.
1,"He knows his stuff. Kind of unclear sometimes, you've got to sit close. Seems like he has sniffed a few too many chemicals though the guy is a bit out of it."
1,he curves tests
-1,Not much explanation. Very Interesting. Good stories and jokes. Ignores questions often. Answers to after class questions are stock.. repeat from lecture... more explanation is hard to get
0,Good all round.
1,"Awesome professor, definitely would take again"
1,"Ko is extremely helpful, willing to help students, and will gladly repeat a step if asked. Incredibly friendly, approachable and very knowledgeable."
-1,"Fun, helps students out but vague. Then sometimes changes mind on how to do your project the next week even when its too late. Confusing. I worked hard and final project was disappointing."
1,"Ko is an indispensable Motion Design professor to have at Art Center. He's very creative, respectful and fun - to learn from. However, he could have pushed more - esp. in the beginning and not wait till the mid/endterm for big critiques. He is not as orderly/org. as the other teachers, so be sure to have your ideas solid early on."
1,"Just do the work and you have no problem. Very cool and chill instructor. I took him for 3d motion graphics. Teaches cinema 4d at a good pace and is helpful with the final project. Small class, seemed more like an independent study (which was a good thing)."
1,"Probably the best math teacher Ive ever had! Seriously so clear and helpful about everything in this class. A very hard class to take, but taking it with Honda is your best bet."
1,"Highly recommended for Math 226. His teaching style is very straightforward, and he explains difficult concepts pretty well with visual examples and analogies. Very approachable during Office Hours as well. The material isn't easy, but if you go to lecture and attend SI (key!), you'll be fine."
1,He is a good professor. On several occasions he helped me with specific questions during office hours. Take him if you need to take cal III
1,"He is a very good teacher. The class is not easy just because it is difficult math, but the teacher does an excellent job explaining. If you attend class, do the homework, and maybe attend the SI sessions, it is a fairly easy course. I recommend Ko Honda as your teacher."
1,No Comments
0,"At first I thought this class was a joke, but he eases you into the harder course work and has no accent, which compared to most math professors is amazing. It's not mandatory to go to lectures or discussions, but it's pretty hard to keep up without both."
0,"The lecturer is a little unorganized at first, but he truly cares about his students and their success. He is very willing to work with students and holds personal study sessions on Sundays. He can be tough to understand, but he truly tries. He reviews before each test which leaves you completely prepared. Overall, he does a good job."
-1,Teaches Statistics. Just overall a bad teacher. I would NOT recommend taking his class. He wont tell you grades when you need to know whether to do extra credit or not.
1,He is such an amazing professor. I would take him again ad again if I could. There is a lot of vocabulary terms for each Chapter that must be completed. In addition to that a lot of small essays.
1,"He uses his former business experience to teach in the class which helped me understand better! Friendly and gave good lectures. Group projects throughout the semester, but they weren't too bad. All of his old quiz questions were questions on the final so make sure to keep your quizzes."
1,"If your want to take Business I / Finance? He is the right one! He can teach you how to make planning for your business, and how to safe your money by your personal budget. His a nice professor, funny & humor. Test is easy! Just following his schedule to finish group planning, and presentation in the final, you would get good grade! Recommend!"
1,His class is more about a group business project. He sometimes rush in the book lessons but teaches you the essential of business. He gives credit just to show your homework. I liked his class because tries to teach you and understand the real business world by doing the business plan.
1,He was helpful because he answered the important questions.
1,"Has Been the best business instructor I've had to date. Very clear, Very interactive. Encourages class participation and Group discussions. Having the book is generally a must. Homework was usually a written paragraph as part of a Group project."
-1,"Complete waste of time if you really want to learn and even if you just want to pass with decent grade. Professor has no idea of what he's teaching, gives irrelevant assignments,no structure, no syllabus, no lecture plan.Expects students to know what to do!! Does NOT TEACH at all!! Makes you stay till class is over and makes you talk amongs yoursel"
1,"Awesome professor, definitely would take again"
1,"Professor has amazing lecturer, he makes his lectures interesting. There will be in class assignment, make sure to go to class so you dont miss any points. He's a tough grader"
-1,"I went into this class thinking it would be relatively entertaining and ended up having to change my writing style to something that was reminiscent of grade school. Prof. Obayani also had a tendency to be a little discriminatory in his thinking, which was also reflected in his choice of reading materials, none of which were on the original list"
-1,Beware taking his class. He is very inappropriate and unclear. He's also rude and will blatantly insult you in front of everyone. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. If you want to pass prepare to kiss a lot of ass and work non stop
-1,"his class has been unbelievably stressful. I'm not even finished with the semester and I can tell you he's definitely not a good instructor. it's already been said that he's unorganized and difficult, it's true. don't take his class if you're a feminist. it'll only make you mad."
-1,Read the novels you will have to write essays on them. He's anal about the structure of the essays. It does help your writing skills though. Go to class or he won't pass you.
-1,"Prof. Obayani's class defines the word stress. You have to read a 300-400 pg book and write a 10 to 15 pg reaction paper every two weeks. Obayani himself can come off very rude and sometimes inappropriate, but, his objective is to help people develop their writing and critical thinking. Very possible to get an A, but you'll have to work really hard"
-1,BAD!!! Very unclear!!! DO NOT TAKE.
-1,"He is a terrible professor. The basic breakdown of the class is 4 essays and 4 novels plus work from the textbook. He is very unclear. After my group had nearly finished a 10 page paper, he decided he wanted it differently(more examples and 15+ pgs) so we had to rewrite the entire paper after spending HOURS on the original one. Find another prof."
-1,"I AGREE WITH AT LEAST 15 OTHER COMMENTS THAT I HAVE READ SO FAR...HE IS A BAD PROFFESOR... he will insult you infront of the class, and try to make you look bad,he is very sexual and likes to ask the girls in class sexual stuff,very hard on his essays, and he makes you read BOOKS (400 p/book) in 1 or 2 week DONT TAKE HIM !!!"
-1,"Easiness-Not an easy class, lots and lots of essays, tough grading. Helpfulness- He isn't helpful very much, unless you go and spend hours and hours in his office getting specific instructions. Clarity-No Clarity, he is as clear as a salvia trip. Overall he is egotistical, mean, narrow minded, disrespectful, and not a great teacher at all."
0,"tough professor. He will definitely make you work. Despite the work load, he's very cool. The course can be confusing at times, but overall he really wants to help you. If you put in the effort, he will not fail you. If you're looking for an easy A - DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS."
1,"Really hard professor for 098. He expects a lot out of his students. Still he is the best english teacher I have ever had. He really teaches well and wants all his students to learn. If you want a free pass to 155, don't take this class. If you want to have the ability to succeed in 155, take his class because it will prepare you well."
-1,"THE WORST PROFESSOR IVE EVER HAD!!!! He is the biggest jerk ever! If he does not like you, you will have the hardest time in his class. He wont have any trouble insulting you in front of the whole class. Very rude!!! you wont learn anything!"
1,"HE IS A REAL COOL PROFESSOR. I LEARNED ALOT IN HIS CLASS & HE TALK ABOUT REAL LIFE SITUATIONS. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SHOW UP,READ THE BOOKS,AND VOICE YOUR OPINION. HE TRIES TO HELP YOU AS MUCH AS HE CAN JUST ASK FOR HELP IF YOU REALLY NEED IT"
-1,i learned more when i was studying english at an ESL school.
-1,"HE IS THE WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER & AND I MEAN EVER HAD. If he does not like u it is a sure thing that u will not pass the class. He is full of his self and thinks that he is the only person that's right. You will NOT LEARN how to write, u will come out of his class more confused than ever. He also has u buy his own books which r so inappropria"
0,He was a really great teacher. He is hard and intimidating and he says whatever is on his mind. But if you show you want a good grade he will give you that grade. He talks about real life and he wants students to leran. Just read the book and have you own opinion.
0,Never judge a book by its cover
-1,"Did'nt learn anything about writing, in his english class."
-1,he is really hard teacher. U will never pass his class if he doesnt like u.
1,I had him for english over the summer and he was very hard at first until he gets to know you and he becomes a whole lot nicer... i was soo suprised i got an A. Great teacher
1,"he is a very hard teacher, ans sometimes intimidating, but if you pay attention to what he asks for and take notes everytime he writes on the bored then you will be able to class. If you choose to not to take notes then you will struggle alot in the class"
-1,No Comments
-1,"If you want to get credit easily, you choose the wrong one."
-1,"Do yourself a favor, avoid him. He reads these comments and comments himself also."
1,"he can be intimidating, but after you get past that characteristic, he is a good guy. very helpful during office hours. you have to keep up with the reading or else you're screwed. he taught me how to write and in the end wasn't a bad guy. he is a GOOD teacher, but only take him if you WANT TO LEARN. if you want an easy A, this is not for you"
-1,You definitely have to keep up with the readings if you don't then you can just forget about the whole thing. Try and speak up about the book if you know things and let him know that your really trying. Keep persisting even when you get back papers with lower grades than you expected. In the end people who did everything and really tried succeed.
0,"i took all AP classes in high school, none of which prepared me for this class. Very tough and time consuming, it can get very emotional. He is very intelligent but has problems of his own he often relates to. If you have a lot of time on your hands and want a challenge, take it, it will improve your writing dramatically if you can keep up."
1,"Excellent teacher. The best I've had. Not for most students because most students arent looking to learn. Most are looking for a good grade. That wont come without LOTS if work in this class. Only for those who wish to improve their writing, take on a challenge or those who wish to FAIL. When I say lots of writing , I mean lots of writing."
1,"The Professor iS A VERY HELPFUL TEACHER. hE DEMANDS a lot from the students but its worth it. Even though we read a lot in the class, its worth taking this class. Very challengy . If your looking for an easy class to take, this is not the right one people. If he see's your interest, he is willing to help you outside the classroom (office hours)."
-1,If you like to write papers and read every second of the day than you'll like him. He is very particular in what he wants. grades tough. tries to be a hard ass with students. if u can avoid him do it.
0,"HE COOL....MAYBE A LITTLE INAPPROPOIATE, BUT STILL COOL...MADE MY WRITING SKILLS ALOT STRONGER"
-1,He is the worst ever. I have never had a professor that was so insensitive. PLEASE D0NT TAKE THIS C0URSE!!!!......
-1,No Comments
-1,I would advise all the students to stay away from Obayani. I had him 13 years ago in Pierce College and I found him to be a total jerk. I am surprised he is still around. He would give students good grades in exchange for favors. One student got an A in his class by fixing his car!
0,"At first I hated him! but towards the middle of the semester i just realized he was trying to come off as a hard ass to weed out the students who dont really try. He really cares about his students and wants them to learn and succeed. However if you're looking to take an easy A, DONT TAKE HIM, you have to WORK HARD to earn your grade."
1,"Professor has EXCEEDED my expectations. DON'T be fooled by FALSE statements about him. He really cares about his students & is adamant about their success. I enjoyed every moment! Class lectures are always FUN & ENERGETIC. If you don't like participating, this class isn't for you. NO PAPERS, 3 easy tests, 1 presentation. HE MAKES MUSIC CLASS SO FUN!"
1,"I remember when I first took his class, I thought I was going to hate him because he comes off as a really ""tough"" professor but as time passed, he is SOOOO cool. As I think about it, i believe he was one of the most influential teachers I ever had. PERIOD. Yeah people say he's an **** but he just doesn't take no of that ****!!"

-1,"This guy is a jerk. He comes off all ""high and mighty."" He doesn't help students just tells you ""do,"" with no explaination. If you can read his writing you may be able to understand what is going on otherwise, forget about it. He als"
0,"he assigns a lot of hw, and papers. but the conversations in class are out of control. i learned a lot in his class. he helped me a lot as far as keeping my grade up."
0,No Comments
-1,"Man.... dont do it!! if your not a girl, this foo is your worst enemy. I was there every single class session and failed. He undresses female stundents with his eyes. To many pages in too little time to write for freshman comp. i definately wouldnt recommend this professor to anybody unless your a woman. if your a guy, keep it pushin playa"
-1,"Took this course freshman year, BIG MISTAKE. One of the worst professors I've ever taken at CSUN. Ridiculous amount of LONG papers in too short of a time. Very arogant. Many things he says are INNAPPROPRIATE. Be prepared to work your ass off writing papers for a C or worse!"
0,"He is a very good teacher. Loves to spread some of his knowledge with his students. If you're doing bad he will tell you ""You're slippin'"" which is a sign for you to get your butt on track. Yes his class may seem hard and maybe too much writing but overall i loved his class."
1,Is a good guy!! He can come off as an ass but it really nice. Always available if you need help and very understanding. I love the man!!! Very Wise. His class should be taken!!!!
0,Professor is a cool teacher he will definitely teach how to write. At times he can get on your nerves but after all the papers you write you will feel super accomplished.
-1,"Makes you feel stupid for asking simple questions, gives long papers with vague subject, goes off talking about Brazil and women, sometimes inappropriate."
-1,Too many essays in too short of time.
0,"If you write his papers, you'll be fine. Just don't ask him why he went to jail. motherf***r will stare you the f""""* down... he also knows alot about the****.:)"
0,damn this prof is smart as hell.. but hes very hard and gives alot of papers..dont be surprised when you have to write two papers about 8 pages long each in one week
1,"TIGHT TEACHER!!! THIS MAN HAS SOME STORIES TO TELL, BUT DONT GET ME WRONG YOU ARE GOING TO WORK YOUR ASS OFF WITH THEM PAPERS!!"
0,"The man is crazy. He actually brought a **** to our class to talk to us, plus he sells books out of the trunk of his car. Get on his god side a.s.a.p. cuz I will feel sorry for you if you don't!"
-1,"Very cool guy,an intellectual knows a little about everything. get on his good side and your okay. you will have tons of papers and reading but you can do horrible and still do well he just wants to be sure you grasped everything he attempted to teach."
-1,"You better get on his good side early if you want to pass the class. Participate in class discussions, which always go off topic. The guy had a hard life and will make your life very hard with endless essays and unreasonable demands."
0,"Professor will work your ass off and use shock value often. After completing his course, you will be forced to learn alot and be genuinely interested in the topics. Also very unspecific in essay assignment subjects. Overall: very good professor!"
1,"Professor is a cool professor. Sometimes he has class discussions on things about life which get interesting. He's been through a lot. For a black professor, knowing how to speak chinese is really cool. He integrated a white school back in the day"
-1,"Professor wasn't hard actually. He was very unclear and all the essays he made us write were pointless. He makes you think, that's true but not about learning--about leaving."
1,Although this teacher was VERY HARD I do have to admit that I learned a lot for him. He is a great professor and will definantly make you think. By the end of the semester you will feel like you accomplished so much and will walk away with so much.
1,She's a really good teacher and I was able to understand everything. She is very easy to talk to and is happy to help with anything you need. She explains things well and uses lots of examples. I noticed that she looks like Emma Stone when she smiles (just thought I'd put that in!)
1,"She's a really good teacher. Always helps you out and her class is never boring. But sad to say she's going to another school next sem. Since i had her for summer, we didn't have any exams. Just take home quiz and 4 projects. which were extremly easy. We didn't take a final exam just had to do a final project. REALLY EASY."
1,She's super sweet and soo nice! Her class was really easy as well. She gives you a study guide and everything on it shows up on the test. She curves the tests sometimes too so I managed to get over 100% on every test. It's really not that difficult...just dedicate 2-3hrs of studying before each test and you'll be fine. not that h
1,"don't expect to just get an easy 'A.' Your going to have to study. Her biggest flaw is that she is a new mother, and she doesn't realize when to stop being a mother and when she should be a professor. She doesn't treat her students like adults. She buys into the fact that shes super sweet and cute, but she can be really dull and boring. Lectures zz"
1,"Very Sweet teacher! Knows what she's talking about and uses good examples. I recommend taking her class, its interesting and fun"
1,I took her for 131 and now 129 and...I love her!! She is very nice and she cares about her students. Take her if you get a chance!
1,"She is one of the coolest teachers at Grossmont. She really understands the subject and answers any questions you have. You get a study guide for every exam, and as long as you know what's on there, you'll do fine! She's an amazing teacher! Definitely recommended."
1,4 exams for which you get the best study guides ever. Know the stuff in the SG and you'll pass it for sure. you get to observe little kids and write about it. Just use lots of definitions and its an A. The final you get to bring a cheat sheet!!
1,"I really love her! Trust me, if you are just entering into child development, you want to take her. This is my major and I am really lucky to have gotten a wonderful teacher for my first class. I really learned a lot and she reminded me why I chose this major in the first place. I will take Amy again for sure!"
1,She is an awesome teacher all around! She is very knowledgeable and explains everything so you can understand. Assignments and tests are clear in instruction and fun!
1,She is really nice! And the class was really REALLY easy if you study the study guide. Everything on the guide is on the test. so just memorize everything and you'll get an A+ for sure!
1,"She's too cute, you just want to be friends with her right away! A great teacher too, very knowledgeable and likes to teach CD. Gives you copies of every power point so that you can focus on the lecture vs. write, provides excellent test study guides, and makes the class comfortable, fun, and funny. Review the study guides & the tests are EASY!"
-1,"The Lecturer was rediculus, thinks she's so cute. Made class harder than it should have been."
1,The Lecturer is really great!!! she makes a tough class easy. i took a summer session which was very fast paced! i ended up getting an A+ in her class. i learned a lot. take her! take her!
1,The Lecturer is the best teacher! She's so nice and sweet. But she's a great teacher too! She's really funny and makes cool jokes to help you remember things. She gives really good study guides for the tests.
1,"Very informative teacher. She gives study guides for each test, that are very doable. Great class, I highly recommend this professor."
1,"Was a great teacher, and very helpful. Is very clear on her teaching!!"
1,I have taken 4 of Amys classes and she is the best!!! Out of all of the CD teachers I have had she is my Fav friendly and informative...She Rocks!!!
1,"Excelent teacher, always makes class great"
1,"I LOVE THIS CLASS! She is such a wonderful teacher! She always explained everything so thoroughly so there was no way to misunderstand. She was extremely helpful and had original ideas for teaching. To learn child development phrases and ideas, she had us play the game ""Pyramid"" and it made the class so fun! She was so friendly and put everyone at ease. Best class I've ever had."
1,The Professor is a wonderful and extremely helpful teacher
-1,"BLAH - unorganized, never got responses back till a few days later. nice lady but I don't think she cared much."
-1,Presents herself as sweet but don't be fooled. She doesn't like it if you miss class or come late. She is very knowlegeable and will find info if she doesn't know. Allowed a note sheet for final. Is willing to look over work before it is due so you can get most points.
-1,the class was most helpful and applicable to everyday life.I felt Amy was very sincere and seems to REAlly care about her students.Thank you Amy for your bright smile anf kind words and kind eyes.
-1,Sweet heart! Very awesome attitude! I don’t think it is possible to be any nicer! She is still young and passionate about her teachings. She will go out of her way to help when you need it. Class is set up on power-point. Gives study guides which are sufficient for the tests!
-1,"The Lecturer  is the best child development teacher at Grossmont, and I've had them all. She gives a study guide for the mid term and everything on the study guide is on the test."
-1,"I think she was a very cool teacher! She was super sweet! Her tests were pretty easy, you just need to make sure you take good notes cuz most of her tests were from the notes, she gave out study guides and just make sure that you listen to her lectures. She was a really sweety and very patient :)"
-1,The Lecturer is the best instructor I've ever had. She's very thorough and knows her stuff. She gives you study guides for all the tests and the papers are easy as long as you follow her instructions.
-1,"The lecturer is one of the best teachers I have ever taken. She is very knowledgable in a lot of child development topics. She is very clear about what is expected from the assisgnments and she gives you a study guide for every test,which are mostly mulitple choic"
-1,"This was a summer online hybrid course. It was an easy class but the projects took some time. I never got the book, the lecture notes are good enough. Amy is very nice, I hope to get her for a CD125 class in the fall."
0,"She is a really nice person,and an OKAY teacher. I'm taking summer school and I'm not sure she's a good summer school teacher. She lets the class get off topic, and in a summer class, theres really no time for that. But other than that, she's a sweetie."
0,my friends said she was easy but not really i got a bad grade on one of the essays and it messed me up...got a C because of 2 points she dont care.
1,The Lecturer is the most amazing teacher and woman in the entire college. I couldn't wait to wake up every morning just to see her awesome smile. She is the sweetest and most caring person i have ever met.Easy to pass if you study.
0,"Didn't really care for her too much. Too much ""I know a..."" class discussion left us with less learning time and more print outs of what should have been taught. Her tests were very easy - didn't even need the book."
1,"First time with hybrid course. Amy was just as nervous as the rest of us to the outcome of the class. Very prepared, clear, and caring. Tests easy. Assignments need a lot of hard work but are worth it. Excellent teacher."
1,"really sweet and caring. test are really easy.the research papers i think she grades really hard,so do super good on those. fun and easy class.learned so much."
1,Assignments time consuming and require deliberate thought. Cares for her students.
1,"Wonderful educator. She is close to our age, so we can relate to her on a different level than most teachers. I love the way she teaches and uses examples from her own life. Study guides are just like tests. Love her, love her, love her"
1,"GREAT GAL. VERY EASY TEST & 3 NOT SO DIFFICULT ESSAYS. DO NOT REALLY NEED THE BOOK, CAN PASS THE CLASS WITH JUST LECTURE NOTES. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CLASS FOR AN EASY ""A"""
1,"Shes a Great person,very helpful I highly recommend taking her! Easy tests."
1,"A GREAT professor/teacher. I learned so much in her class. She really cares about what she teaches and cares that others will learn from her class. She also has a Great smile, and is very cute."
1,"She is so cute! Such a great teacher. 3 papers but they are easy, tests every other week but they are not bad at all. I loved her class so much and she is such a great teacher."
1,"Real good teacher that makes everything easy to learn, plus she has a personality that makes her hot!!"
1,The Lecturer is a very good professor and she is very helpful and communicates effectively to her students
1,The Lecturer is a great teacher. Her lectures were money. The test were easy if you payed attention to the lectures and looked over your notes. The papers were really easy.
1,"Lecturer is very organized&knowledgeable. If she doesn't know the answer to one of your questions, she will find it for you. She encourages class participation and dialogue. Her class was fun&educational. Heavy workload, but manageable. Great study guides."
1,"Very sweet person with incredible knowledge. In short; okay class, easy tests, HUGE load of projects and busywork. Not good if you HATE working in groups, thats basically all you do. Guys will not like, because they lack emotion of any kind whatsoever!"
1,She is a very easy teacher if you take notes and answer questions on the study guide. It is a lot of busy work. She is a very nice person.
1,"Wonderful Professor. Easy tests, great study guides. Always there to help if you need her. I recommend taking her."
1,"The class is very easy but boring, especially if your a guy"
1,She is a great teacher and she really knows what she is teaching. You will learn a lot in her class that you can use in your life. She is very interesting!! Everyone should take this class.
1,Very easy. take all the notes. answer all questions on the study guide. test is exactly what the study guide is. Easy A. very sweet.
1,GREAT teacher. Knows her stuff and great test study guides. TAKE HER. sweet too!
1,"She is a very good professor, Subject matter expert!"
1,"Funny, witty, charismatic, friendly, approachable, explains concepts thoroughly, mentions test q.s as he teaches, answers q.s after class, allows exam makeups, extra credit, simple project. Keeps things upbeat, tells fun stories. Can be a bit intimidating (just a little, the way assertive people tend to be). Really fun to argue with. Good looking."
1,"The best professor I have taken at NYCCT!!! You get to learn how to subnet quickly and efficiently. Like to give pop-up quizes. Pay attention in class, ask questions, read and study the book. I wish he would teach CST3607 and CST4707. Fair grader and will answer all your questions!!!!"
0,"Fair professor. Likes to give pop quizzes as for the lectures he uses powerpoint slides and they are pretty long and in depth. He likes when students ask him questions, so just study the book and the slides that's key to pass the exams. There are 2 exams, 1 midterm, 2 pop quizzes and 1 final. He drops the lowest score of the exams."
0,"Solid professor, but he is very PowerPoint heavy. His tests are entirely from the textbooks, so be extra sure to practice the review questions. The questions he picks are random and sometimes don't relate to what he previously taught, so be extensive when studying the book. He's also a bit of a jerk. He once roasted a girl for implying he was old."
1,"Must take! He is the best professor I have taken in citytech as far, and I am a Junior. He is very caring, will learn a lot in his class just pay attention. His tests are easy!"
0,"Decent teacher and would take again. As previous reviews mentioned, his lectures are powerpoint heavy and get boring. Read the chapters every week and study the questions from the book. Usually gives a quiz on each chapter based on HW questions. Like most classes just do all the work and you will receive an A."
-1,He is a good prof but he lectures are toooo long it would be better if he did more hands on overall easy prof for A grade
1,Good Professor. Lecture's are a little bit long and heavy but it does keep you on topic. In my situation he helped us through the midterm and made sure everyone did the extra-credit question and made sure we all knew what we needed to know. If you can please take him and you will be satisfied.
1,"Great professor for those who are new to networking. Always ready to meet your questions with real world solutions. My only gripe is that I was less receptive to slide lectures, but they are not heavily relied upon."
1,Nice professor. helpful. wants you to learn. i am sure anyone taking this class definitely wants to learn and get into networking field. he helps you learn and get the stuff. few pop quizes. Easy class.
1,"Has own business so knowledgeable about his work and practices it. Work load was not bad at all, got an easy A."
0,so so
1,Great young professor. If he sticks to teaching he will be amazing. Take him. Beats Sebili.
1,"very nice teacher, rides a bike ;)"
1,Professor is pretty helpful.
1,"No tests, good class. He can ramble but he’s very nice. Treat him well he’ll treat you well in return! Half page reading reviews but that’s all the work."
1,"He is the kind of professor that is not worried about testing you heavy or loading you up with homework, quizzes, yada yada. He cares whether or not you leave his class understanding the material. He really cares about his students and is always available if you need help. Take him seriously and you will learn alot."
1,Very helpful and easy class. Offers extra credit (easy projects) and very nice. He truly wants the best for his students.
1,"He is my favorite. He really cares about his students in every way. If you come to class he notices. You can usually find his tests from past students, he altered them for my class. TIP-it helps to read the chapters on your own. Class is laid back and he'll help you in the end if you have great attendance. He wants you to get connected."
1,"He is a nice guy who REALLY cares about his students. His test are hard, but he never changes his test so if you can find a previous one you're set. He offers extra credit. He tends to ramble and repeat things but he's pretty interesting. Class isn't mandatory but I advise going anyway because he gets pissed when no one shows up."
1,He is very nice and funny. He likes to tell jokes. But he tends to ramble on. His test are hard. He does offer extra credit. But there is no homework or quizzes to help level your grade out. so if you dont take notes or read the chapters you will certainly fail his class.
1,He is awesome! Hilarious and honest he will tell you the truth. While attendance isn't required you need to go cause taking notes won't help you and his tests are oober hard. He wants you to learn though so find out if you can stop and talk to him about the tests so he will help you. He wnats what's best for you so don't expect anything less.
-1,"Rambles on and on about nothing in class, and even if you take good notes and know the book you can get to the test and see completely new material. Most people get As because they are in the Ag fraternity and get the old tests from them (he has never changed his tests)."
1,"Funny stories. He is a good teacher bc he let's you learn the hard way that the tests don't only cover class notes, make sure you read chapters and take notes. Very laid back, simple man but one of the smartest I will probably ever know. But he smokes like a chimney :("
1,He is an amazing guy! I screwed up and missed half a semester of his class...and he sat down with me and discussed my options for the rest of the semester. I ended up passing with a B. He can be a little boring...until he sets the vial of pig****on your desk.(True story) Take him. Hes great!
1,He is an awsome old cowboy... if your interest is cows then you can learn alot from him.
1,one of the most helping and genuine professors ive had
0,"He is extremley smart with cattle, but his lectures go nowhere. To pass his test you need to find the old ones. But have no fear, he gives 60 points worth of extra credit just for turning it in. EASY A!"
1,"He is a really nice guy and he really cares about his students but the tests are hard. They are unpredictable. You never know what could be on it. So pay attention to everything even his jokes and bits of facts. However, he does do extra credit. So take advantage of it when you can"
1,"Amazing! Great teacher. Loves what he is teaching, very knowledgeable. He keeps up-to-date on new information in his field."
-1,"He's a great guy, but can't teach at all. His tests have nothing to do with the study guides. You never know what he's going to ask on them. He never takes role so you can skip a lot, but i would try to find someone else to take animal science with."
1,"Great guy....really does care about how his students do in all thier classes, not just his. always has some kind of ""life lesson"" at the beginning of class. always 5-10 minutes late so you dont have to worry about ever being late to his class."
1,"He is the kindest man that wants students to succeed and get a real education here at MSU. he is one of the most helpful and kind teachers i have ever had. he really cares abut his students. the class is ok, and he really tries to teach with alot of examples from his own experiences. the tests are med difficulty. you need to really study to get A"
-1,I agree with the last person. OL is a great guy and he's really nice. But he just lectures all hour about personal stories. Then he gives a study guide that is never anything like the tests! I just can't seem to do very well in this class and its a 100 level course!!! but i'm doing great my my 300 level ones!
-1,"He is really nice guy. I guess if you are a little more interested in what he is teaching then the class would be easier. However, he tends to tell a lot of stories. He does offer a lot of extra credit. Just make sure you read and study a lot."
1,Livestock judging is a fun class. There's only one test and the final is giving an oral set of reasons on a class of beef cattle. OL does kinda assume everybody knows the terms he uses though and it can go over your head.
1,"He is a good teach & he really knows his stuff. He will tell stories all the time that make class funny & he likes to get to know you. Sometimes he is hard to follow & his tests are hard, but if you study you will get a good grade because he grades really easy, but there are chances for extra credit"
1,This is the best class for anyone to take. One of the smartest men i know. Take him every chance you get.
1,He's the best! Really laid back too
0,tries to make the class as easy as possible but is not a very effective teacher
1,"If you truly apply yourself, then Mr. Barrow will award you accordingly. Just Don't give up! He loves for his students to have questions. Also, any and every question is a great question that someone else would also like to know, but may not have the confidence to do so. Just learn and ask questions. Easy A!"
1,"The teacher was great, he goes over the problem very well, and if you don't understand he will go over it again. His very helpful"
1,This was the first math class EVER that I was looking forward to attend throughout my college experience. Professor Owen teaches the math in a manner that will help you understand the material so much faster and it's so much easier to get done. Attendance is a must it can get tough if you miss a lecture since he is very detailed.
-1,skips multiple steps in whichever section he's teaching. Highly unorganized. He didn't have a curriculum prepared so it was all over the place. late to class every day. he tells you one thing then he's all over the place. Students would correct him and he would just stare at the board and be like ah ok then if the book says so.
1,A VERY EXCELLENT Instructor. Come to class do the homework and pass the final! He gives extra points as well. Knows his stuff well!
1,Professor  is a really great professor. Goes over the material over and over. Easy A. You will pass. Just how up to class because if you miss. You will miss a lecture and can critical. Overall has great great teaching method and is really funny at times
1,Professor's curriculum is very comprehensive and he makes math easy to learn. I decided to stay with this professor from math 113 throughout math 125 and it was the best decision for my academic experience. He is a terrific educator which is rare to find these days.
1,"He is a great instructor, took him for Math 112, 113 & 114. I loved math in high school, however it had been 25 years since I took math. Prof. Barrow's was able to make the class interesting and easy to grasp. I would recommend him to everyone!"
1,The Lecturer is a great teacher he cares about each student. He explains thoroughly his lessons with great feedback if you don't understand any part of the problem. I would take him again due to the way he goes over each question and explain them so you feel comfortable and confident that you have made a good choice in selecting him as a teacher.
1,"Great professor, would take him over and over again. Very caring and wants you to learn. His step by step learning process helps students understand. Definitely recommend. Hope he teaches Stats"
1,professor is a fantastic professor he's well respected among all his students who have taken him several times because he's such a good professor Hell make sure you learn the material He's clear and concise he's slow and methodical and he really cares that you get it He simply the best for math
1,Professor is a great teacher. His teaching style is to help all students to understand the concept of the Math level he is teaching. I would recommend other students to take his class. His personality is great and he also communicate well with all of his students.

1,I have had a hard time with math my whole life. I have taken so many different teachers and always dropped because I wasnt getting it in the speed it was being taught! I am so grateful I took Mr. barrow for 2 semesters so far for 113 and summer 114. He is by far the best math teacher I have ever had! Im actually confident and liking math now!
1,"He has a very unique method in lectures of making the math simple and easy to follow as long as you can remember sequence of steps for the equations. Ask for help, you will receive walking away with confidence of solving the equations. What really helped me was taking test only on the 3-4 chapters at a time .He's the Best don't miss out ."
1,"I took Professor for Math 125 during the Summer of 2017, which is a 6 weeks course. I've taken this class before with another professor & failed. Barrow explains the material well. He tries to make math as simple as he can & teaches in a way in which you actually learn. I received 100% on all my tests, thanks to the knowledge he shared with us."
1,Math is not my strong suit but he breaks it down and makes it all so easy. Anyone who isn't strong in math this guy is the one to get. I passed his classes with A's and B's . He's the truth!
1,GREAT teacher. If you are not very strong in math this is the teacher for you. He breaks the problems down and works with you until you understand. The notes we take in class are very helpful when doing your homework and general understanding. Highly recommend him. Well respected and knows his math and wants you to succeed.

1,Great
1,"Taking him for a winter session, he is an excellent professor. He teaches good and explains everything in ways you can understand. He reviews homeworks and any problem from the book you don't understand. He makes problems look easy. He gave us two tests and a final and his tests are not multiple choice but they're not long."
1,"I took math 125 twice before I took professor Barrow. He made math so simple to me. He makes sure to clarify anything if you do not understand. He will break every problem down to the point where you tell yourself math is so easy! Take him if math is difficult for you, I promise you'll love it!!"
1,"He is the best, he's very patient and he goes over the material repeatedly. He wants you to be successful in passing this class. His lectures are clear, no tutor needed. I had not taken math in 25 yrs and passed. Expect homework he will go over it. His focus is for you to pass the final exam he will review. I'm taking him again for 125."
1,Best Instructor @ LATTC!! I hated math until I took Instructor Barrow!! changed my life!
1,Ived always had trouble with math because the teachers ived had in night school I'm glad I'm in this class now! I completely understand and if I don't then he explains and helps you
1,Had no interest in this class prof. Barrow made me understand it tho. Not hard he encourages students to ask questions. He does have a accent but it's understandable. Just come to class (clearly) and pay attention.
0,Like ti keep intouch with teachings and technic's. Learned esteem.
1,I've never been the type to enjoy math until I entered Mr. Barrows 101 class last semester. Since then I enjoy math more than I ever have ! He makes it to where you are able to understand it and he doesn't move on until he knows that everyone has the concept of whatever he's teaching that class. I'm glad to have had him for a teacher. A+ professor.
1,"He is honestly one of the best math teachers I've had. He makes class very interesting and very easy to understand. if you're a shy person like I am, you will come to find yourself very comfortable to go up and ask him questions. He's a very nice and friendly teacher. Make sure to buy your book & take notes!"
1,Great teacher. During the break we would talk about sports. His test are fair and easy. Just study and pay attention. Easy A!! :)
1,EXCELLENT!
1,"He is the nicest math teacher i've ever had, I took him for 2 semesters. He has soooo much patience and breaks everything down very easily so u can get it. He's also funny. Mr. Barrow I still owe u a haircut! lol"
1,"He is the BEST! I personally can live without math, but the way he teaches it doesn't bore me to death. He's really clear once you get over the slight accent, he's also a really nice guy. He's patient too. I wish I could take all of my math courses with him. GREAT PROFESSOR, he really knows his stuff."
1,He Is A Great Math Teacher. He Has A Step By Step Approach To Every Problem. He Makes Sure He Go's Over Every Line. He Gose Over The Homework And Most Of The Problems On The Mid Term. He Makes Math Easy So You Really Dont Have To Ask Or Go Elsewhere With For Help. Mr. Barrow Is A Great Math Teacher. S. Andrews
1,Math 115 is a breeze with the Professor.He is very good and he explains it step by step. A very nice math teacher and he will explain it until you understand it. Very smart teacher and well dress gentle man. He only teaches in the summer. He also teaches math 105. I do nbot like math but with him he makes it look easy.
1,The lecturer opened my eyes to the world of mathematics that I thought i would never understand. His methods of teaching is clear and he takes it step by step so you can follow the procedures for solving the problems. Hes one of the best at lattc.
1,No Comments
-1,"this professor will pile you up with homework, no late work accepted, rarely ever extra credit and when it is given, she never taught it. extremely test heavy and overall too much work for the easiest math class in college"
-1,Some say she's hard to understand with her accent but I understood her fine. It's how she doesn't understand questions by students. I did the homework and managed to understand most work but she is strict. If you want an easy class pass on her but if your willing to work then go ahead.
-1,She can be fine at times but class is stressful. It's a lot to do and when she wasn't nearby the class would talk about how we are failing and this class is killing us. If your willing to do the work then you'll be fine but if not don't bother taking her unless you have scholarships to back you up if you fail.
-1,"This is the absolute worst professor you will ever come across. She does not have the credibility to teach, assigns homework problems that do not exist, fails to provide dates for when the tests/quizzes are, and cannot answer the simplest questions. She can't speak English clearly and has sent emails with lots of misspelled words, so be prepared..."
-1,"Beware of her moving a quiz ahead and not telling the class, if you can even understand her through her accent. She will openly discuss students grades and also has a tendency to yell and generally be very rude. Often, she would spend her lecture period yelling at the class for not doing well and not understanding the material and not blame herself"
-1,"Thick Russian accent but can get past that and still understand her. Only problem is she speaks and goes too fast. I asked once if she could slow down, she actually told me I should keep up cause that's what is to be expected in higher level classes. Asked for help on one hw question, I got a side eye and attitude. Felt un-encouraged to keep going."
-1,DO NOT take this prof. I had her for a lower level math class and almost failed. I don't consider myself to be too bad at math but she made it nearly impossible to learn. Not to mention she has an extremely thick Russian accent which made it hard to grasp what she was saying. I wouldn't recommend her to anyone.
-1,"I did quite fine in her class, but if I didnt already know this material, I dont think I would recommend her to anyone. If youre lazy, dont take her. Shes hard to understand at times and when you ask questions, she doesnt really explain or answer your question well. She thinks shes teaching but she gives bad explanations. Very nice, up tight"
-1,Doesnt like if you ask any questions. Terrible. Doesnt give much help. And will receive a 0 on any test you dont attend to that day
-1,She rushes through her lectures. Doesn't interact with the class to see if we have questions or help.
1,"You will have to do a lot of homework: the best way to learn the material IS to have lots of practice. She gives you credit on problems you get wrong if you show your work, drops your lowest test score, and is accommodating if you have any issues. The final is standardized, meaning she didn't write it. She does everything possible to prepare you"
-1,One of the worst professors I have had. She may think shes teaching but shes not clear in her instruction and asking for clarification leads to more confusion. If not for the book I wouldnt really know anything.
0,"This is def. a course that you need to put at the top of your priority list. She gives way more homework than I have ever seen a teacher give, but she does go through notes thoroughly. She will call people out in class for sleeping, texting, etc. She isn't that bad, but I probably wont take a class by her again."
-1,"Will call you out in class if you don't pay attention (NO whispering/ eating/ phones/ sleeping). Just counted, I have literally 226 homework problems for our current chapter (2 wk duration). Most require more than 1 answer. Will give partial credit on test answers, and give 1 extra credit question. Sometimes lets out early (night class at least)."
1,Professor is very good but does expect you to have a solid understanding of previous Math classes. 7-week semester so everything was excelerated with a solid amount of homework with a test and quiz every week which is normal for short semesters. Most tests are no calculator with no multiple choice. Extra credit available on tests and quizes
1,"She is a tough teacher, but really care about helping you understand Math. Her methods were simplified and to the point. If you are lazy then don't take her class. She gives a lot of homework, but it is needed to learn the material. Ask questions, she's happy to answer them."
-1,She has a very thick Russian accent so she is hard to understand. Her tests are really hard and she doesn't give a lot of help. She expects you to know everything and makes you feel dumb if you don't. Do NOT take this prefessor.
1,"She is very a stern teacher and some people didn't like her. However, her class was very organized and the most of time I know what exactly I am doing because her direction was very clear. I believe her teaching technique is real. (some teacher don't know how to teach)She was a stern teacher, but I want to take her class again. Very helpful."
-1,Horrible teacher
1,"Very nice,she simplified the math prob. for the class.Goes over math hmwk prob we didn't undrstd.She does like questns after class,(limited time).Schlcrt gives us so much & little time,she has to cram,grades fairly,pt systm if u did the wrk on qz/exm she still gives pts .even when its wrong. She will help u, just ask-I misjudged her,ask aftr class"
-1,Terrible teacher. She does not like for you to ask any questions. When you do ask a question she has a really bad attitude while answering it. She also has a very strong accent. You can barly understand her. If I were you I would NEVER take this teacher.
-1,You dont want to ask questions she lets you know that she doesnt like it. You should know it all before you take this class. She doesnt like to explain anything.
-1,"Horrible teacher, strong accent, terrible attitude, not clear, talks down to you."
1,At first the class was sort of overwhelming because of the transition from Python to Java. But Hueston always had extra resources and help to guide us through any problems. Hueston was a good professor and I think he did the best with what he had.
1,Professor was faced with a hard class this term as CS 121 is not meant to deal with the transition form python to java. Because of that the class seemed harder at first. Heuston on did everything he could however to help and was a professor that genuinely cares about his students. He did keep stiff deadlines with 0 exceptions. Still great.
-1,"Went to maybe four of his lectures, even less of the labs. He teaches nothing in the lectures, just rambles on about technology nonsense that is not relevant to the class. He is just an odd person and its very frustrating that he doesn't care if the MyITlab program is down. Don't go to lectures or labs and focus extra hard. the final is impossible."
1,"A good teacher with a laid-back teaching style. Course covers somewhat difficult material, but with plenty opportunities for points and extra credit its easy to get a good grade. My only complaint is that he taught more on concepts than he did on code; such as I understand how a binary search tree works, but not how to code one."
1,"Really good professor. Keeps things relaxed but still expects work out of you. As long as you pay attention in class and do what is asked of you, you'll do just fine."
-1,"An absolutely terrible professor. He took 50 points off of one of my projects because I forgot to print it to a text file, but had everything else 100% correct. I worked hard the ENTIRE semester and spent hours on each project, but this discrepancy dropped me from an A to a B-. Unfair at grading and poor/vague instructions."
1,"he makes it easy for the students to understand though the course is a bit on the tougher side. labs are helpful but at times really boring. the assistants he has are also really helpful...overall, i would recommend his course..."
0,"Class is so boring, but he takes iclicker points so show up. Labs are really frustrating, he has lab assistants who dont know what they are doing, and horrible directions. Luckily the lecture tests are easy! He is a new prof so he might get better with some experience."
1,"Professor  is a great professor! The class is easy and he's willing to go the extra mile to help you. The labs were annoying but you have to suffer through them. Overall, I highly recommend Hueston."
-1,Had to wait until next class to get any question answered because he had to ask another professor. Recorded another professor's class and literally copied everything the other professor said it seemed like. This meant he didn't actually know the material he was teaching. Did not explain important things we needed to know in the homework.
1,"He is newer CS teacher, but he is really awesome! He's always willing to spend time with students to make sure they understand the way certain programs function or to review your code. Being a recent graduate, he's very down to earth and familiar with students. As long as you understand the material and read you will do fine in his class."
0,"A good professor, lots of homework, but clear instructions, further explanations can be gained through email, allow about 24-48 hrs for an email response, sometimes sooner. About 5 or 6 papers and an end-of-semester report. Overall good teacher, but not my favorite class in general."
1,Great teacher. At first seemed tough based on her syllabus introduction but she wants you to succeed! You will have no problem passing her class as long as you follow directions and do your work. Very caring. Gives fun projects!
1,"Professor Choudry was awesome and super caring. Very low maintenance. Only homework was a weekly chapter summary (1-2 pages) and a weekly video summary (1-2 pages). There were 2-3 tests, all easy to pass. I can genuinely say that I learned soooo much from this professor and class that I will definitely use in my future as a teacher. 10/10 recommend"
1,Great online class! You'll read one chapter a week and write a one page summary on it. He is very flexible with grading. I don't think I ever received a grade under a 90%. Do not stress about the 5 page term paper. Tests are all super easy and done through d2l with no webcam.
1,"I love this guy. I've taken him for two other classes and the first time I was scared because the course isn't very clear, and that I wouldn't make an A. But honestly, if you put in effort and show up to class it's an easy A. Plus hes super sweet and reminds me of my uncle."
1,Choudry is a good guy. He is also extremely smart. Make sure you go to class and do all of your assignments and you will pass. This was his fist semester of teaching Assistive Technology. The grading was unclear and the midterm was challenging. But I did learn a lot in his class and he is really passionate about special education. TAKE HIM
1,"I appreciated that he structured the assignments for all learning types. You will do group activities and group assignments often, he uses powerpoints, videos and movies and of course you will have to read your text. He also uses guest speakers. Test are multiple choice. If you don't understand something he will go above and beyond to help you."
1,This class was awesome. He is a very hands on type of professor. He is very good at what he does and you can tell he has a passion for the work he does. I would take his class again for sure!
1,Great professor- truly has a passion for special needs students- easy class just do your work and you will get an A or B- I really enjoyed him even tho he lectures LONG
-1,Great professor- truly has a passion for special needs students- easy class just do your work and you will get an A or B- I really enjoyed him even tho he lectures LONG
1,University level course but great teacher; very willing to help you if ask for it. Will prepare you well for transfer.
1,Has a great passion for the subject and extremely willing to help. Class is passable however impossible to get an A. Tests are extremely difficult and class average is always below 50 percent. Curves slightly so that 85 percent is an A for the course but it won't really make much of a difference. Take the class if you are a genius.
0,"I disagree with people who gave him negative comments. Those people probably didn't come to class and spend little time studying chemistry.The key to do well in his class is to read the chapters before come to class, do the first 10 problems at the end of each chapter, attend all the lectures, and do all the practice quizes and midterms he posted"
1,"Professor is incredibly enthusiastic about the material he teaches. From my experience, his tests are based on lecture/book and he does help you during office hours.Chem is a diffuclt subject itself, so you can't just rely on him to get the grade you want."
-1,"Very passionate, but literally, bad methods in teaching. Everything is obfuscating. Whether you use the book or utilize the pre-test, actual tests are based on completely different materials."
-1,"he is crazy and lazy better learn from the book. unorganized,unhelpful, and all around rude. do take him don't put yourself through this b/s man's class unless you like throwing away your money b/c gettin an A doesn't mean anything from him. just that you wasted your time money and energy on a fool."
1,"Good teacher, very enthusiastic"
-1,Professor  requires his students to have internet access to receive homework assignments and assistive material. test have little relation to homework/book material. Requires more understanding than offered.
1,Loves chemistry and teaching
-1,"the guy can't teach. period. take him if you've got an unnaturally high IQ, if not then find somebody else...anyone but him."
1,great
0,"He is a really nice teacher, who is enthusiastic about chemistry. Although his tests were a bit hard, his class is not unbearable. If you study and ask questions, you'll get through it just fine. He also has practice tests and tries to help a lot. I learned a lot from his class."
1,He IS the best science prof I've taken. He's passionate about chemistry and truly takes priority in his students education. He teaches at university level but caters to everyones needs. He DOES grade on a curve and anyone who puts effort into the class will do quite well. I highly recommend taking him!
0,"The comments below are not fair. He's there for a paycheck? Although I think the class is indeed challenging, I can assure you that Prof. Olds teaches because he wants to. He may not be that clear in his lectures, but if you take the time to ask for help in his office hours, you'll understand the material."
-1,"This guy knows his subject but can't teach to save his own life. Lecture is pretty much nonexistant. He just goes over the hw problems that only the 3 smart students do. And if he does lecture, it not clear, it's unorganized and confusing. Take this class if you're the self learn type of person. If you need a good prof, take Cheli Fossum at Laney."
-1,"He was so unprepared for labs, and unfortunately did not work toghether with the lecture teacher. we were often unable to do the labs because he didn't have the materials or did not know the procedures. I am sure he nows chemistry bu he doen't know how to teach it. I tried aproaching him for help but it was useless. I ended up having to self-te"
-1,"This teacher knows his material but does not know how to teach. His tests are nothing like the pretests, what's discussed in the book, or the lectures. I studied and read the book and felt pretty ready for the tests at times, but totally bombed it because it was nothing like what he says at all! And he also does not curve!"
1,He's not a bad teacher. You just have to study a lot and get help from either him or a tutor. His tests may be hard but he's a very good teacher and cares whether or not you learn the material. He's very passionate about chemistry.
1,"Professor Olds is not as bad as these comments portray him to be. But I do agree that his class is hard, but he's only trying to prepare you. He teaches a lot and is very informative. He is very enthusiastic and a great teacher. You must make use of his office hours though, I find them to be very valuable. There is a lot of math involved, but"
-1,"Lecture? What lecture? He told us to open our book, do a couple problems, then left for 15 minutes. Avoid this guy at all costs. He's just there for a paycheck."
-1,"Absolutely terrible instructor. Unless you have a chemisty background, you will not be able to hang. I was studying 30 hours a week JUST FOR THIS ONE CLASS and was still failing. He teaches no theory, just calculations. There is more to chemistry than calculations. I ended up dropping. It was that or fail all my other classes too."
-1,"man, if you have any sense...stay away from this guy. not only is he THE worst teacher i've ever had, he is also the most unorganized, unhelpful, disrespectful, and just plain lame. all this AND he is overly demanding, putting many things on the test that were never covered in lecture or the text. did i mention he changed the text 2 wks into class?"
-1,"She have a sub by the name of mr. willson, do not take this guy he is really really hard. he gives open book testing, and problem sets and when testing time comes he give problems that he have not went over and if you tell him he tells you to figure it out! even student in his class that have so chem back ground find him very difficult."
-1,it's okay to take his class
0,"He is a good teacher, just study hard and get A"
1,"chem1B - Because of these comments made before about professor olds, every one is scared to take his class. I am saying from personal experience that he intends to teach you to be ready for university. If you want to take an easy class, look elsewhere but you'll look like a fool when you take classes in university. Hes a great guy, cool teacher!"
1,"I was scared off when hearing about this teacher from previous comments but after taking his class, I learned these were comments left by those who don't even try in class. The one thing about Prof. Olds that I have found in no other teacher is that he really loves he teaches. He just wants to get you ready for university level chem."
-1,"This teacher is horrible. He cannot teach. He does not explain things clearly, and he is not helpful. By the end of the semester, there were literally only FOUR people left in his class. He sucks. His tests are super hard. You're basically on your own."
-1,"terrible one, don't take this his class"
-1,This teacher doesnt know how to teach although he likes to think that he does. you have a test every thurs and they are tough. he doesnt curve even though the class average was a 50%. Your midterm is 400 points and you also a regular test that week on Thurs as well. Final is 800. Doesny explain things well at all.
-1,No Comments
-1,She is the hardest professor I've taken at SSU. He is a very tough grader and you have to come to class in order to pass. Most of the class fails most of his test but not all. Come to his office hours to get more help and try to use his previous tests from old semesters to help you study for the new ones. & He expect you to already know alot.
1,"I had the opportunity of taking Dr. Ola for Organic I and Organic II, and I must say he is an awesome professor. Indeed, he does make you work hard (seriously hard) but his intentions are always good. He ensures you will learn and is very understanding when it comes to getting extra help because he offers tutorials. He's really an awesome teacher!"
1,"Professor seems unapproachable, but if you are having trouble and cannot get to a tutor just ask him he will answer anything. Tests are tough but he gives freebies (take homes and do overs with same stuff on it) often to bring the classes grade up. He sends study guides with practice problems for everything. would take again!"
-1,"She is very sarcastic! Organic Chemistry is a hard class in itself and he doesn't make it any easier! his test are torture there is always a written part that counts for a bunch of points, he doesn't give much hw for practice, no extra credit so don't even think about it! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND HIM FOR OC LECTURE OR LAB"
-1,"Overall, he is a good teacher. He is very sarcastic. The subjects he teaches (organic chem) are hard subjects, therefore the classes themselves are hard."
0,"AVOID taking him (for summer school) if it's possible! We started with 25 students and ended up with only 10 BEFORE midterm. As a person, he's cool but as a professor his tests are HELL. Don't listen to what he say will be on a test. Expect to memorize all formulas and study that chapter, chapter before that, & 1 after that ."
-1,dont do it
0,So his course was challenging and I admit he doesn't outright gives answers to chemistry questions but he does place you in the right direction to obtain the answer. Having taken his course and experienced teaching/tutoring the folks who are taking his course are approaching Organic Chemistry thinking that you don't need to study. Who does that?
-1,This is by far the worst class I've ever taken!!! The more questions you ask the more confused you are. I really think it was a bad idea to take this class for the summer considering they have condensed 15 wks into 5!!! I have never had to stay up all night and study for tests!!! He is not helpful at all!!!!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!
-1,She is a horrible teacher... I wouldn't advise ANYONE to take him... not even my worst enemy..you can't understand anything he is saying and his breath stinks something horrible... When you do ask him a question he rushes through it and you still don't understand him...it's worthless... almost eveyone in my class has an F!!!
-1,"FAILS ALMOST ALL THE STUDENTS IN ""HIS"" PRE-REQUISITE CLASS WHICH IS NOT EVEN COUNTED TOWARDS THE DEGREE. SNATCHES THE TEST PAPER WHEN ""TIME'S UP"". VERY ANGRY AND UNPLEASANT"
0,"Has a accent, so it makes it hard to understand. Sometimes even he doesn't know the answer to the question."
1,He was really nice and he cared a lot about making sure we succeeded in the class and in our goals. Would definitely take again
1,"He is a really good TA, lenient grading, and always helpful during labs. Chill dude who is always open to questions. Take him. Remember sig figs on the labs and prelabs though."
1,"His exam questions are more likely from the example questions or homework problems. If you spend time for homework, you will be fine to get a good grade."
-1,Exams were impossibly difficult. Lectures were confusing.
-1,"NEVER TAKE THIS PROFESSOR, HE CAN'T TEACH FOR THE LIFE OF HIM, ALL HE DOES IS HAND OUT SHEETS AND DOES A FEW PROBLEMS ON THE BOARD AND HE MESSES UP ON THOSE PROBLEMS. HE GAVE US A TEST WITHOUT EVEN TELLING US AND HE IS JUST A GENERALLY HORRIBLE PROFESSOR. DON'T TAKE HIM AT ALL COSTS."
-1,"my first semester and Ive been stuck with him. if it wasn't for me being in the class, no one would understand anything. his accent is horrible, as well as his teaching. he makes no sense whatsoever and it causes more confusion when he makes constant mistakes and cant answer questions. he also goes off topic way too much. pick another professor!"
0,"Though he is a nice guy who works really hard to educate us and give us good grades (his exams and homeworks are pretty simple if you are good in math), his thick accent makes it difficult to understand what he says and old age casues him to make small mistakes frequently. He might want to consider retiring."
1,"He is absolutely the best in the field of mathematics in the world! Ask him anything and he can simply figure it out. His whole life is dedicated to his students and he takes his work extremely seriously. Without him, I would be a ""nobody."" Thanks to him I am successful. I use his unique and helpful techniques all the time. He should write a book!"
1,"Please do not disrespect him. He was my professor in 2006 and was extremely helpful. Just try your best, youll get an ""A"" He was a ballistics expert in India and holds about a dozen PhD's."
-1,Students were very disrespecful towards this prof. bc of his accent & he's elderly. He tries to help students but his methods are hard to follow and understand. I took a double period & that was the worst. It's so much info. Daily HW & about 3 exams. Tutoring is a must w/this class. Good luck.
-1,"OMG this proff, ugh. he made me buy a 150textbook for no reason.i have yet opened it!i dont understand him and everyone takes him as a joke.DO NOT TAKE HIM!"
-1,honestly he knows alot about math but on the other hand he teaches his own way. Sometimes it is hard to understand due to his accent and for example he will teach you a formula and as soon as you understand that concept he teaches you the same thing a different way soo it's a little confusing.
1,"This little man is a genius among men. If you don't understand the way he teaches, move up to the front. He can apply math to any topic in the world. Best math teacher EVER."
1,greaT PROFESSOR VERY HELPFUL JUST ATTEND CLASS AND DO YOUR WORK AND YOU CANNOT FAIL!
-1,He is very confusing and his heavy accent does not help. Athough he does attemt to be helpful. This was the worst class ever!!! I dropped it!! Don't recommend this class if you don't do well in math it is a waste of money. He does not respond to email's and does not know how to work the online aspect of the book he makes you buy so your stuck! Ha
-1,"OMG...he doest know****...the whole is lost. He tries his best to teach us, but his explaination of stuff is harder to understand. I think only 1 person know what the hell is going on. Dont take him if you dont know nothing about math because he will confuse you...trust me"
1,kool teacher... the accent is alittle wierd but he is really dedicated and wants to help the students. he tells us new ways to reach same answers... just easier. You need to pay attention in his class though... and dont walk out in the middle... he gets really hurt and almost makes u feel guilty cuz he is so dedicated.
0,He seems pretty good so far. He is really dedicated to teaching his material and making sure we understand it. Hopefully he'll stay this way til' the end.
1,Hard class especially if you are not a math wiz like myself. This professor does everything in his power to help you. The homework is via the internet. difficult. try 2 get that out of the way so you can focus on his handouts and will go over test before given. dept final hard. try not 2 fall behind.but if you put the effort in you'll be fine.
1,A must take.. as long as you actually try and dont be absent you will pass... regardless of grades.. He makes math undcerstandable until you get it but of course dept final sucks....
1,"Very easy teacher, as long as he feels you are trying to learn, and you actually show up... you will get an A whether you pass the tests or not."
1,"he is the most nice, understanding professor he trys to make math simple for everybody he will always whiling to help and answer ur ? he is the best of the best i would recomend this class to everyone he makes you wonna learn and he is easy greader someone we really need. He makes you wanna learn and come to his class, he is the best prof i everhad"
1,He is a great professor soooo easy. Just show up to class and you'll pass. He is a very dedicated professor and really wants his students to learn and help them understand the material.
0,he is a good prof. sometimes he loses his train of thought. it seemed hard for him to communicate his ideas. he is a sweetheart and tries to help you when you are confused. not too much work.
1,"THIS IS THE BEST PROFESSOR I EVER HAD, HE MAKES MATH SO INTERESTING HE IS ALSO VERY GOOD PERSON, HE IS THE BEST OF THE BEST IF YOU PLANING TO TAKE MATH TAKE IT WITH HIM AND U LL NOT REGRAD IT I THINK HE IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE SCHOOL"
1,"HE IS THE BEST MATH PROFESSOR I EVER HAD, HE MAKES MATH SO INTERESTING HE IS ALSO GREAT PERSON"
0,"He is difficult to understand in the beginning, but if you show that you are trying, he will pass you and not just with a D."
0,"Professor Chugh is what you would classify as a dedicated professor. Trust me when it comes to math I am practically illiterate, but if you try your best and do your part in class. Believe you would pass. Take this professor, do not let his language barrier fool you!"
0,"He isnt too bad, he makes math interesting and he has some cool but kinda weird techniques that he seemed to have made up himself. Take him but pay attention and it wont be too bad."
1,"He is from India, pay attention and you will pass this is a course that you have to take for must majors. Stick it out, I have had alot worse then him, he know the subject."
-1,"he is very difficult to deal with, understand, and to talk to. BUT TAKE HIM and stick it out, because it isn't until the end that the whole semester seems like it was worth taking. At the end he puts all his antics aside, and you'll pass PAY ATTENTION"
1,"If you have problems with math, You must take this professor. Teaches well and makes math tolerable without the anxiety."
-1,"He knows what he is talking about but does not know how to get it across. He also does not pay attention to your questions. He answers something totally diffren. But It is and Easy ""A"" if you can just keep up with him."

0,"You have to give very detailed information on your assignments. Be ready to read a lot, write a lot, and you better to be very active on discussion board. Be prepared to work on this course (reading, working on assignment, participating on discussion board) for about 30 hours a week. You will learn a lot (for that time you spend, yeah...)"
1,Pretty cool:) Thanks for wonderful Micro and Immunology classes. Helped me lot in MCAT
1,"Cool Prof. :) Very helpful, easy to approach. If you aren't doing well in his class, means you aren't studying material. Can't wait taking Genomics... class in next semester."
1,Wonderful learning environment in class. Loved it!! Learned a lot in Immunology. Not scared taking MCAT after this class.
1,"He is a wonderful Prof at UPB. Very helpful, willing to work one-on-one, just finished Mol Bio course, even though the material was tough but he made subject easy to understand--specially the regulatory factors of transcription and translation mechanism. Labs were useful and fun to learn. Just can't wait to be in his Microbiology class."
1,Thank you  for wonderful Immunology course. I learned a lot in this course. Can't wait to take microbiology with you in next semester!
1,What a great professor at this campus! Thank you for giving students research experience while also making all genuine efforts to teach in class for us. Can't wait taking another class with you!!:)
1,I had the honor of attending two of his classes. He genuinely exemplifies the very best of UPB. He encourages his students and challenges them as well. He is truly very deserving of University's Presidential award!
1,"Took his Microbiology class, awesome experience. Very helpful to make clear concepts. Strong in Molecular biology. Always teach advance mol biol. Thanks, your class was very helpful in my MCAT exam."
1,He is very helpful when students are unclear about specific assignments and coursework in general. A variety of students complain and say he is too hard but that is because they do not attend class and listen to the lectures. He is an excellent professor.
1,His Immunology class was very helpful for me in my graduate school. Thank you  for making clear concepts.
1,Very helpful Professor. Took his Microbiol class last semester. Made everything clear and concise. He goes long way to help students even after they graduate. Many thanks to him for making things easier for me during my studies at UPB and afterwards.
1,"He is wonderful Prof at this campus, believe in research based teaching - not the old textbook type reading and learning."
1,"I took his Microbial Biochem. class. Great class. All biochemical pathways are now on my tips. Now, I'm taking his Immunology class. I thought it would be a hardest course, but he made every concept easy to understand. His chapter quiz are helpful to prepare for exams. Very helpful Professor."
1,"I was in his microbiology class. Wow!! I learned a lot!! Love this professor. Always willing to work with students. Gradings some time gets little tougher, but that is OK, as long as I'm getting the material."
1,"Extremely helpful Professor. Very informative for Microbial Biochemistry course. Tests are from material covered in class. Few tricks involved, but necessary to be to think about the material"
1,"Wonderful professor, knowledgeable, work with students. Believes in research based learning. You will be lucky, if gets in his lab to research in microbiology."
1,"One of the best professors at this University in biology department. I wish to learn from him in other classes. Smart and very knowledgable, easy to approach. Highly research oriented. Believe in hands-on teaching practices."
-1,"He doesn't teach too well. He mostly just reads off the slides. He's a smart guy though. He also changes his mind A LOT. One second it's extra credit, the next it's required."
1,He is wonderful professor at this School. Very knowledgeable and helpful
1,"I loved his class. As long as you go to class and pay attention he'll work with you. The day before one of his test my uncle passed and during the test I couldn't think straight. So I turned in a blank test with only my name on it. A few days later I went to his office and he looked up my grade with was an A, and gave me a take home test."
1,She is one of my absolute favorite instructors. The class was tough but I would do it all again. He's an excellent professor who really knows his stuff!!
-1,"Very difficult. If you plan on skipping, save yourself and drop the class NOW! If you miss one day, you will be behind all semester. He is hard to understand sometimes due to his accent, and will not answer his office door unless you schedule and appointment (even if he is inside and NOT busy)."
-1,"FAILS ALMOST ALL THE STUDENTS IN ""HIS"" PRE-REQUISITE CLASS WHICH IS NOT EVEN COUNTED TOWARDS THE DEGREE. SNATCHES THE TEST PAPER WHEN ""TIME'S UP"". VERY ANGRY AND UNPLEASANT"
0,"Has a accent, so it makes it hard to understand. Sometimes even he doesn't know the answer to the question."
1,I think he genuinely wants us to do well but he needs to understand his audience and know that not all students know calculus since elementary school. Also surprise quizzes are not a the best way to validate students knowledge.
1,This is my second course with Gharib. He explains how everything works under the hood from scratch. Lots of details if you are really interested in the subject. The AI Cybersecurity course was heavily focused on coding it seemed like an advanced lab but i liked it. Tough exams
1,"Deep learning explanation is really good taking equations and numbers. I have never experienced anything regarding Pytorch before, but now Im very comfortable with it. Can easily learn how the neural network works. Various concepts of deep learning and how to make it privacy aware and secure."
1,"Interesting material, ability to practice, instructor is very knowledgeable and able to explain by providing simple examples, which helps in understanding a course. Learned more on the topic of deep learning and how to make it safe"
1,"Fairly fast-paced class, but definitely makes the lectures interesting as long as you engage in the class and study on a regular basis. Much more of a modern teacher who understands students' habits and way of thinking. He is always available for help and will go out of his way to help if you ask. Can be funny at times too."
1,"He is passionate about the course,and like to share his general knowledge. A little hard to approach, but can help you genuinely if you ask for his help. He believes in hard work and dedication. Plus, watch out! He practices martial art."
0,the way to teach needs to be slow.
1,"You can use the textbook, but all of the codes and how to use the programming languages is all over the internet. He does a really good job making this class very doable even for first time programmers. He knows that not everyone in the class is a syntax master and makes every assignment and test very passable. Extra credit also given."
1,Great inspiration
0,"tough guy, not approachable but work hard and you'll pass"
1,"He is tough as nails, and the class goes about 2000 miles an hour but he knows his stuff and can explain it well. Pay attention, try and keep up, and you're going to pass. Don't? Good luck. You'll need it."
1,I like his sense of humor and passion for teaching
1,Homework load is very little but many quizzes
1,Young professional that knows what he is doing. He helped me a lot!
1,"I love his new style of teaching . He obviously cares about students. few Hw, more quisses"
1,He usually drags out the class with stories. But that the best part of the class. Be ready for quizzes.
1,His teaching technique is very different from others and seems more close to students. I would love to take other class with him!
1,I like the stories he tell.
1,"Attend all classes, solve all book problems and you will get an A. He is one of my favorite professors at UMKC"
1,Very helpful. It's inspiring to see a professor younger than you! I liked his lectures.
1,"Too many exams, but I think that helped me stay on track and keep studying."
-1,Too much show off! Needs a major revision with his teaching skills. Not useful! Doesn't pay attention to each student.
1,He dresses nice
1,He lets student come up to the white-board and solve problems.
1,"Having students try out problems on the board. (USA teachers did this in past decades and it worked well. Its rare now, sadly.)"
1,Thanks to him I like math now!!!
1,I thought he was very difficult in first class then he turned to be friendly..
1,He always inspires students with his out-of-lecture stories and advice
-1,"She is very picky on format and she has no mercy at all (make sure you follow the instruction). She said ""All i have with you is grade, others i don't care at all"". Oh well... I hate lecturer like this."
0,She is a decent professor. The class is not too hard and has a very manageable workload. She pays attention to detail a lot and she wants everything in a specific way which might sometimes be challenging. It might sometimes be unclear how she grades papers and what she wants from you exactly. Overall both the class and the prof are OK.
1,She's *awesome*. Really fascinating prof and easy on the eyes too!
1,"She was my adviser freshman year, and we still keep in contact. One of my favorites ever!"
1,She's fantastic! Very good knowledge of her field and really interesting class.
1,She is a good listener and gives great feedback. She is very passionate about her field and it appears that there is nothing else that she would rather do. I feel that she is always trying to think of new ways to keep us interested and current in what is going on in the theatre today.
1,"Excellent teacher, his instructions are completely clear. Very focused in class. His tests are fair, he is very helpful to students. Definitely would recommend him to everybody."
1,Excellent teacher. Clearest professor I've had. Prepares you well for the tests which aren't that hard and he is really fair. Take him.
1,"The Professor is great, and you can learn how countries use economic tools for development. We read some important articles and research in China, India, Argentina, Korean and etc. Exams are mc type and essay questions. If you study, it is easy to get an A."
-1,"If you aren't that interested in country development, I would not recommend this class. Professor Ghei is VERY knowledgeable about this subject (which is great), but her lectures are extremely dry and, to me, often lacking a point. She also doesn't foster good/any discussion. The grade includes 5-6 quizzes, participation, 1 briefing, and 2 exams."
0,"Prof definitely knows her stuff. But she's not the best at communicating the material as her lectures are all over the place - hard to follow. Still, very nice person & pretty fair when it comes to grading. You learn w/ the textbook and use the lecture slides as a guideline bc the slides aren't very helpful. Not the best but def not the worst class"
1,"She is super nice and has an incredible background, though I personally found lectures a bit dry as there's a lot of ground we have to cover. If you try it's easy to do well in the class, exams are pretty straightforward with no math involved. Midterm, final, 750-word writing assignment and 5 quizzes (you drop the worst 2)."
1,"I took her class without any reviews and now I can not recommend her enough. During a stressful semester, she was so accommodating and approachable. Her lectures are really interesting, nuanced, and she is always open to exploring new perspectives, even though she has incredible experience in the field. Learned a lot and had a good time doing it."
-1,Work hard to get good grades but i suggest you not to take classes
-1,"She is nice don't get me wrg but I swear what I do/did for her class is the most I've done for any of my classes.There r tons of articles, readings from the text,&videos.They are not short either. This class is so time consuming.I would still feel like a full time student if I took just her class. Hmwk is all over the place too, pretty unorganized."
-1,"She works too fast. I am in her class right now & she is going too fast or not explaining it enough. Yes she gives examples but she'll talk about them over lectures and not write them out. I am a visual learning & reading something to me I have doesn't help. If your just taking this class for a credit & are fulltime, don't, it's too time comsuming"
1,Expectation complete all assigments.Do all your posting keep in mind of the Rubric Grading. You only have two exam But all quizes and exames short-answer eassy.Other than that very good Instructor
1,"Excellent, love her. Makes material interesting, not easy to do with economics sometimes. Patient and helpful"
1,"EIU is lucky to have her . She works very hard at teaching interesting information, and puts it on everyone's level. Her instructions are crystal clear and she is very receptive to questions.Follow her instructions and you will do just fine."
1,"Excellent class, excellent professor. Highly recommend this class. Plenty of work each week, but very interesting. Breaks down econ theories with entertaining video clips/pop culture. Easily the most professional lessons of any class I've taken at EIU."
1,"Quality teacher, professional, one of the best. Interesting mix of lecture, terrific web links, book, independent work. Highly recommend this class."
1,"Very good teacher. I absolutely hated my macroeconomics class, but she made microeconomics bearable! Lots of clips but it was usually a good break from the class part. The final project was to use a song or video clip to show how economics affects our daily lives. Very good teacher, I'd definitely take her again."
1,She's a nice lady. We watched a lot of video and music clips that were a welcome relief from lectures. She tries to help as much as possible. The final is optional. She gives online homework that gives you the correct answers so that there is no reason not to get a perfect score. I would take her again.
1,She is by far the best teacher I have ever had. She makes the class fun. She also doesn't make it extremely difficult while still teaching her class. She genuinely cares about her students.
1,good teacher overall
1,"to sum up, fair. you know what is expected of you and she is readily available outside of class for help. she gives a lot of homework, but draws from those homeworks to get test problems. Easy enough to get an A or a B if you try."
1,"Unlike most profs, she applies the socratic method while lecturing. She thus gives topics as much time as needed for students to understand. Students stay involved in class (ie, don't fall asleep.) Homework is fair and effective. Tests are fair. She is always willing to help students before and after class."
1,i liked the class
1,Easy as hell...takes exact questions from multiple choice online for tests...easy A
1,He is a great. I took her for Macro and Micro Economics and as long as you take notes and study your notes you'll do fine.
-1,if there were a award for worst teacher of the year she would get it ......terrible arrogant and very unhelpful
1,"He is very passionate about what he teaches, which makes for an interesting class. He is a pretty easy grader, but make sure you're participating in class discussion, since it counts for a good chunk of your grade. He's also difficult to understand when he's speaking, but you get used to it."
1,"Show up to class and participate and this class will be a breeze. This class is lots of dialogue and conversation about tackling world issues, so if you are in the politics/human rights world, this class is for you. Dr. Ghere is such a kind man, and knows what he is talking about concerning development and humanitarianism!"
0,"Nothing against him, but I could not understand a SINGLE word he said! He's a great person who is very passionate and available to students, but I ended up dropping the course because I couldn't understand a single word he said.. LITERALLY!"
1,"Amazing professor. Skim the readings, go to class, and participate periodically and you'll do great. Dr. Ghere is also widely available outside the classroom, and will do anything possible to help you academically or after graduation."
0,"Class discussion is mandatory. Don't take if you want to sit back and not add your opinion. Very nice man who is very passionate about his focus. While the topics were interesting, class was boring. We were always off topic and he went on many tangents. Class discussion did not help for the papers and exams."
1,"Extremely friendly man and class discussions are very interesting. Sometimes hard to understand due to a stroke, but is COMPLETELY WORTH TAKING!"
0,"Good teacher and interesting analysis. Class can seem complex and intense, but tests are not bad. As long as you do the reading and listen in class tests are easy. Had a stroke, initially hard to understand but by second or third class not an issue"
1,"Interesting professor whose passion for the subject makes class funny. He also mixes the classes up between lecture and discussion. Don't be intimidated if you can't understand him right away, you'll have no problems after a week or so"
0,"for a few classes and he was a pretty nice guy and a good teacher. That said, his classes can be boring so early class sucks. He also has a physical ailment that causes him to slur his words so understanding him can be difficult. If you scan the reading before class, participate in class you'll be fine."
-1,"GET OUT...DROP IT...the man's NICE sort of, but he has an issue with clarity and speaking...not worth the time...it's destroying my GPA...bad bad class"
1,"Took him for public policy analysis. Funniest man ever. He tells the weirdest stories and some of the things that he probably doesn't think would be funny, are. Tests are easy if you did the reading. He's a cool guy, saw him a Bob Evans once too...."
1,"Loved the class. Read the homework, ask questions in class, and bring up news stories that relate to topics for best results. Very helpful and understanding teacher."
-1,"Loved the class. Read the homework, ask questions in class, and bring up news stories that relate to topics for best results. Very helpful and understanding teacher."
-1,Not clear at all and verrryyyy boring.
1,An exceptionally nice man.
1,"She talks WAY too much!! Take notes and pay attention. She does repeat herself over and over again but knows what she is talking about. Exams are not easy nor too hard, this is college and it's kinda common sense."
1,"Very easy class as long as you go, and pay somewhat attention. She repeats herself alot and overexplains things sometimes. Tests are easy as long as you do the review. Kind of boring at times, but easy A."
1,"Yes, she repeates herself a lot. Yes she can be boring. The one good thing is that you don't have to study all that much to pass. Just go to class and pay attention. She has no tolerance for tardiness or abseteeism. Be sure to be on time."
-1,"Hard grader. obsessed with ""in you own words"". the questions she gives you can't be described in a differnt way. boring. I don't recomend her. lots of homework and essays on tests"
1,she was very helpful and always made sure she was available to answer questions outside of class. She was very nice and genuinely cared about making sure the class learned the material.
-1,makes things harder than need to be. really strange lady. not a teacher i'd recommend to others
1,"Professor is an extremely nice lady, her class was easy and very informative."
1,"She is a great teacher. She is extemely helpful if you need any help through the semester. She gives you a very thorough review sheet for all exams with the exact essay questions, a worksheet to help you with the reading for the week, and a few quizzes throughout the semester."
-1,"I don't know what these morons below me are talking about. She is nowhere near knowledgeable, or a decent teacher. This teacher sucked so bad. Don't listen to them. She makes this class harder than it should be. DONT TAKE HER!!!!!!!!"
0,"Definitely strange, but effective in her methods. Very knowledgeable, but subject extremely boring. No tolerance for tardiness, absenteeism, talking, etc. Just ""old school"" techniques that a student must conform to in order to succeed."
1,"She is a little strange, she appears to be one of those feminists from the 60's that probably burned her bra. however, she knows what she's talking about and as long as you listen in class it would be really hard to fail. no homework, just a 10 pt. quiz at that end of each class. good teacher!"
1,"This is a teacher to admire. She knows what she is teaching and she teaches it right. I admit the content is plain boring and needs plenty of time memorizing, but if u gotta do it, do it with her or suffer."
-1,"Worst teacher ever! DO NOT TAKE HER!! She is so goofy! Sometimes i thought she didnt even know what she was talking about. She would lecture straight out of the book (and repeat herself constantly while lecturing), going to her class seemed almost pointless. And she is an EXTREMELY hard grader!"
-1,"Oh my god she is the worst teacher ever. She was a little funny only, because she was kind of weird. I seriously would not tell anyone to take this class from her. She'll try to help you out, but she's the kind of teacher if she likes you she does if she does she doesn't. Don't take her!"
-1,I absolutely did not like this professor. She was very boring and repeated things so many times. I would not recommend anyone to take her.
-1,"AWFUL. He takes weeks to put in grades, doesnt explain assignments well, expects you to know exactly what youre doing, & is just rude. I wouldnt take this class again if they paid me."
-1,"Takes forever to grade papers, explains one thing in class then expects something else on paper. The only reason I passed was because looked at posted example papers and I went to the learning resource center."
-1,He takes forever to grade things and does not give any feedback. My grades were supposed to be in by August 1st and he still has not graded some of my assignments.
-1,Doesn't grade stuff on time. Doesn't give good feedback takes forever to do so. Very rude and unhelpful. Would not recommend this professor to anyone.
-1,"Was very unhelpful and rude. Assignments were always vague, and the assignments themselves seemed very pointless. The only thing that was helpful was improving my resume"
-1,Took months to grade papers. No communication. Rude.
1,"I was not looking forward to this class, but it was actually enjoyable. Good discussions and while the grading was hard, I learned a lot."
1,"I don't really care that much for writing, but it's something I'm good at. Prof Ghering explains things well and helps when he can. It's not that I don't like the class, it's that I don't like what's required for the class. I don't like to be made to write. make sense?"
-1,"The class was painfully boring, but I did well in it, so I guess I can't say too much."
1,"I wasn't looking forward to this class, but after taking it I found it one of the best at Ivy Tech."
1,"Really great prof. Lectures were interesting, exams fair, and she seems to actually care whether students understand."
-1,"Do not take this class. She doesn't help when questions are asked, does teach what is on the final, and she can't spell. Students were always correcting her numbers in class. I studied a lot and did all the homework and may still be getting a C-, do not take this class."
1,She's *awesome*. Really fascinating prof and easy on the eyes too!
1,"She was my adviser freshman year, and we still keep in contact. One of my favorites ever!"
1,She's fantastic! Very good knowledge of her field and really interesting class.
1,Good listener and gives great feedback. She is very passionate about her field and it appears that there is nothing else that she would rather do. I feel that she is always trying to think of new ways to keep us interested and current in what is going on in the theatre today.
1,"Took the class online. Was well organized on WileyPlus. I just had to read the e-book chapters and take the quizzes. Easy A grade. Learned a lot of new geographical things about Asia, Africa, and South America."
1,"The class was all papers. 15 to be exact. However, if you follow his instructions it is difficult to not pass the class with an A. Show interest and read, read, read. He is an understanding guy, and knows his stuff!"
0,"You're going to be offered a couple different routes in this class, you can write a huge research paper, 6 smaller papers, or do a huge presentation. Honestly the 6 small papers weren't bad, it was manageable, you just have to read the chapter and answer the provided questions"
-1," I have had him for the third semester in a row for my major. This man is absolutely ridiculous. I really think i could teach this class better, etch that. I think a third grader could teach this class better. However, just show up and b.s. all the presentations and you'll get a B or an A. No tests."
-1,"Very easy, no tests, but I have no idea what is happening. He doesn't teach the class, the students do with ""presentation assignments."" I put 0 effort in and have a great grade. Absolutely useless class if you want to learn anything. Geography of Africa."
-1,"Hardly makes sense. Never stops talking about China. Will probably put you to sleep. Those who like to slack: you never have to come to class to pass the tests because he gives out a study guide that is exactly the same as the test, then gives most answers to it."
-1,"He is a really nice guy, but his lectures are boring and useless. he puts all the power points on black board. his tests come from the study guide. all you have to do is memorize it. his chinese accent is still pretty thick. he is a really funny dude though. his class is easy if you show up and study for the tests."
-1,"I received an A without any effort. I had a classmate sign me in 2 of the 3 days a week and slept or texted the day I would actually go. Liu's tests have nothing to do with the course but he gives an exact replica review sheet. I gave 3 presentations in this class, prepared an hour total for them and gave them hungover on Fridays. Still got an A.."
-1,"He does not know how to teach. No one can understand him and he doesn't cover anything that is actually on the tests. There is a study guide that he posts online, and that is the only way to pass the test because it's an exact copy of the real test. The only problem with that is that the tests are 100 questions long!!"
0,he's very nice but his class can be frightfully dull.
0,Nice and willing to help. Funny in class because he makes lame joke. I enjoyed the class because he wasn't a jerk and willing to help you get an A.
0,"Actually said by her in class as a bug was flying around....., "" Oooooh, that's a big bug.....looks like an airplane......must be from Assssiiiiaaaa"""
-1,"Never thought you could get a D on every test, skip 6 classes and pass a class with a B... i'm damn sure going to take a class with him again if I can!"
-1,"You gotta feel bad for him because he doesn't always seem to know what's going on. You could slack off in class if it wasn't for the attendance policy... easily sidetracked which can be amusing. nice guy, but not a great class..."
1,"Very knowledgeable, willing to spending extra time to explain things clearly. I learned so much about map uses. Worth taking. Excellent teacher"
1,Nice and helpful.
1,"he is really nice, chinese and sometimes hard to understand. lectures are boring, but he tries to make jokes and its funny when he laughs at himself. tests are hard because he tries to trick you...not on purpose, but his english isnt so great. lots of extra credit though"
1,"She's really great and willing to help whenever you need it. It may be a little difficult to pay attention in class because her accent is strong and you'd probably lose yourself pretty quick. But if you keep up to date and do well on the assignments which are also pretty easy, this class is an easy A"
1,"Super nice person. Her class is very relaxed and she'll always stop and answer questions. I also like that she posts all of the notes online. Overall, pretty good prof."
-1,"Extremely nice and frindly prof who loves helping, but shes just a terrible teacher. Lectures are poorly set up and has a hard time getting you to understand concepts. She doesnt start from scratch, present foreign ideas/concepts well and engage the class. Her exams are pretty easy though."
1,"Hard to understand sometimes, but she's a very enthusiastic and approachable prof who is always willing to answer questions and help out her students. Has nice notes and covers lots of different examples in class - very helpful. Lectures get boring sometimes, but she is an easy marker and always allows you a cheat sheet for her exams."
-1,"She is a very nice and approachable as a person, but not a very good prof. I found it hard to understand her with her accent even though I'm Asian, so I never attended lecture. Instead I just read the textbook and did all the questions which was sufficient (I got a A+ in the course). On the plus side, midterm and exam are easy :)"
1,"hard to understand sometimes, but amazingly helpful, and once you do get use to her accent she is awesome!!!!!"
1,"Really helpful, used the text alot which made it easy to listen to lectures and not worrie about not have the notes after class."
-1,very hard to understand but she is very nice and approachable. the final was very tough.
1,"She may be hard to understand but as long as you do your assignments your set. Its a great class until the final, thats when she bends you over"
-1,Can anyone understand what the heck she is saying? I never knew an adjective could be a verb.
1,A a great teacher! Course material was easy to understand and teacher was quick to respond any questions I had.
1,Awesome awesome teacher!!!!!! Shes an awesome teacher and it was so much fun in her class!!!! Ive taken two classes with her so far and I loved it! She was super clear on everything and was always there to help!!!! Replies to emails super quick!!! Shes also super encouraging
1,This woman is the definition of the word Precious. As long as you show up and care about passing she will help you out. Her blended class is fairly easy.
1,Professor  is awesome! She is very helpful. She is my advisor always looking for a way to help anybody. She has a great knowledge about her subject and gives great feedback. Her class is very interesting. She is very smart. I can't wait to take her another class!!
1,LOVED THIS CLASS AND THIS PROFESSOR!
1,"OMG!!! If you have the chance to have her, you will definitely have an amazing experience.She is so funny!!! She is my favorite teacher thus far. She really tries her best so that each student will pass her class. She will even give an extension if you need it but if you just do the assignments you will pass the class. Have fun!!"
1,"She is awesome and very educated in her field. If you can start with her in the ECDE program, she will help out as much as she can! She responds quickly to emails and phone calls"
1,She is one of the better teachers I have had. There is a bit of a language barrier with her and participation is the clear cut way of making it out of that class. Her assignments are super easy. The lowest you could probably get is a low B. So much fun to have as a teacher. You are always active in class.
0,She is wonderful and motivating.
1,She is one of the funniest teachers I have ever met.She is Korean and there is a bit of a language barrier but you will get use to it. She teaches her student through experience and is hands down my favorite. She really helped me to clarify things not only for her class but also for my 1002 unhelful teacher. Be open minded!!
1,Fantastic professor. She explains everything in detail. Class is easy if you attend and do your homework. I enjoyed her sense of humor. I looked forward to her class every week. Very helpful and fair. She knows her stuff.
0,She is a good teacher and very helpful.
1,Love her! She's so funny and great!
1,I'm happy to have her as a teacher. She was extremely helpful and I learned a lot! She is also hilarious and I enjoyed her class. She really seems to know her stuff and I highly recommend her!
1,"She is a great professor. She is very helpful and understanding. Sometimes hard to understand certain concepts, but overall very clear in her lessons. I would take her again."
1,SHE WAS A GREAT TEACHER. AND I HAVE FOUND THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO DID NOT LIKE HER WERE VERY UNORGANIZED. SHE KNOWS HER STUFF AND WAS VERY HELPFUL.
1,the class is interesting and helpful
1,"these classes are the easiest classes i have ever had.She is friendly, but sometimes hard to understand because of her accent.She'll help you if need her and is approachable too. if you have problems with these classes you will struggle later."
0,"Overall, she is very helpful when you have questions.Which is a very good thing because she has a strong accent and can be hard to understand. Study her syllabus like the bible and you'll do ok"
-1,She is hard to understand and not very helpful.
1,If you read the syllabus and follow all directions and turn in all assignments you are guranteed a good grade in this class. I found her to be very helpful when it come to homework assignments. She was also helpful in advising me as to what classes I needed to take.
-1,She is rude and thinks that she is so funny. She's hard to understand and I just can't stand her.
-1,BAD TEACHER!!!!!!!!!
1,  She is very straight forward and is clear in what she expects. She had a true passions for early childhood and it show in her teaching. She is very nice and very helpful.
1,"She is chinese teacher, but she is a good teacher in those two classes. Helpful teacher."
1,"One of the best profs I have ever had!! He challenges you to see things differently and really get you to change your outlook on life. He is very approachable, nice, and funny. I have no idea what these other people are talking about!! His hw isn't hard at all you just need to be willing to put in some work. Overall excellent prof!"
-1,Class was overall confusing. The professor seems very strict. Tests and homework were hard to understand. There was some interesting discussions an videos to watch. About a 1/3 of the class ended up dropping the course since no one really had a clue what was going on along with myself. I would not recommend this professor again.
-1,"Makes no sense about what hes talking about, too coonfusing, trys to force to think like him instead of your own personal view on things."
1,Great instructor!
1,TAKE HIS CLASS!! He gives you perfect credit for HW if you did well. Easy exams. He posts practice exams before the exam. The practice exams are almost same questions as exams.
1,"Awesome prof. Well prepared and organized lectures, takes teaching seriously, emails you back quickly, utilizes online resources and definitely knows his stuff. Funny guy as well! If you're a slacker, definitely not the class to take. If you make an effort he'll go out of his way to help you and gives you lots of opportunities to make up marks."
-1,"WORST PROF EVER! He gives really hard exams, even if you study hard it's still hard to achieve a decent grade, doesn't know how to explain really simple problems and is really mean to students"
1,"He is the best, I love this prof simply. Willing to help you improve. Really cares about his students and does exercises from the book and takes up the answers as well. I would recommend this prof to anyone who would like to learn. HE IS THE BEST!"
1,"He is best teacher ever.Good marker, explain everything very clearly.... Best Teacher..."
0,"I had her for intro english (reading and writing critically) this year and absolutely HATED going to that class. She was all of the place with her topics, rambled like crazy and was generally a bit of a flake. She cancelled class more than she held it. Easy marker, but I would still avoid this class with her if I had to take it again"
1,so great. wicked poems. so friendly and funny and you can tell she cares about what she teaches/who shes teaching. wish she taught more classes.
1,He is fabulous! She is so passionate about what she teaches and can really broaden your perspective. She's a really easy marker and lets you write your paper on whatever you chose. I wish she taught more courses because I would take every single one!
1,My favourite prof!
1,Such a great prof. So nice. So open. Really made this stuff interesting. Very inclusive and passionate. Wish I could take more of her classes.
1,"This class takes a lot of time but he is a good professor. He teaches the content in a manner so that the complex topics get broken down easily. However, the midterm had just above a passing average AFTER they had removed an entire question from it. So be prepared to work hard but enjoy his teaching."
1,"Loved Professor! Super nice guy, made the two hour 8am lectures much more bearable. Always accessible outside of class and responded to any questions in a timely manner. Tests are more difficult than expected initially and harder than practice, but once you figure it out it is possible to get an A in this class. He also curves!"
1,"Great prof, he posted all the notes and his notes were very helpful to learn the course. Practice problems were a little easier than the exam but still with some work you should do well. I had the flu for 3 weeks so I couldn't go to class but I was able to still do well since his notes were well written and online."
0,"Doesn't tell you exactly what to expect for quizzes and exams. Doesn't go over the content very clear either. Not the best, but not the worst prof either. Going to his lectures is equivalent to learning the material yourself."
1,Test questions were a lot harder than practice questions in class or home work. Materials in lecture was well delivered.
1,he is an inspiring instructor and her lectures are well organized albeit a little slow.
1,"If you like professors who tell you exactly what's on the exams/tests/quizzes, do NOT take a class with Dr. Roberts. However, his ability to teach problem solving skills nullifies the need to know what's on the exam. The way he teaches theory with concepts makes you able to solve problems you've never seen before without much trouble."
1,"You must attend all lectures, and tutorials are also very important in learning how to solve problems. The professor answers students' questions well, and really cares if we succeed in the course. The supplemental materials posted are very helpful. To study for quizzes, midterm, and the final, I would suggest doing old midterms/final questions."
1,"He wasn't the right professor for me.50% of the total number of lectures, he wrote down formulas and formulas. Even if you initially paid attention it was easy to lose him because he speaks with a monotone boring voice and is a pretty slow speaker. I had to learn everything by myself by reading the textbook which proved to be better."
1,"Lectures tend to be slow in terms of amount of material covered. Answers questions very well. Midterm was extremely difficult but the final was much easier, and he decided to make the final worth more than usual for those who did better on the final than the midterm."
1,"Thermodynamics is a tough course, However Professor makes it easier to understand and more enjoyable. Definitely my top professor this year."
0,"Breaks theory down into small easily understood bits - Will do his best to help you IF you ask a question - Very friendly and highly knowledgeable about the subject - Midterms are about the same difficulty as suggested problems - Posts notes online, however highly recommend attending class - Tutorials are not important to attend Overall good!"
0,"Roberts was a decent prof, he covered the materials with sufficient depth and his assignments were easy but the midterm and final were far harder than anything from the homework or assignments"
1,"I think he explained concepts clearly, giving us a good basis on which to analyze the problems. The assignments were a bit tricky, but if you work the suggested practice problems from the textbook, the actual tests weren't too bad. Dr Roberts was always ready to provide any extra help, and was all around a good professor."
0,"He's ok. I really dislike how he curved the midterm in addition to scaling the final marks instead of the scaling alone. That curve for the midterm only helped you if you were near the average, which I was not. Therefore it brought me down."
0,"As expected the assigned problems are nowhere near the difficulty level as the midterm and final exams. Make sure as you read the textbook and do problems that you write down all the derived formulas and special definitions. This will aid you in your understanding. Attending lecture is pointless, just work hard and you will attain a good grade."
1,"Good prof, but makes very hard exams.The teaching was excellent but I feel like the low midterm average was because we didn't have enough practice problems to work through that are at an exam level difficulty. Overall very good professor."
1,"I really don't understand the previous review. ENGG311 has quite a bit of theory, so the lectures are expected to be focused on that. As for examples, that's what tutorials are for. No part marks? Everyone I know got them! Midterm average was low, true, but that's what curving is for. Overall, I think Dr. Roberts is very helpful and approachable."
-1,"The lack of examples really limits our understanding, and the assigned questions were unrelated to the midterm. The midterm average of 53% demonstrates this. Very lacking with part marks, even if a great deal of effort and understanding was demonstrated in the exam. He awarded us marks on our midterm like they were coming out of his paycheck."
1,"Extremely helpful, had a great TA. if you have questions, just ask. Also responds fairly quickly. The extra credit raised my grade from a C to a B. I would recomend and take this class again. Reading and videos are 45 - 50 minutes. Very helpful information in other classes as well."
1,"Very clear and consistent, presents material very well and can engage student interest."
0,"Very much a self taught class. There are about 18 videos you have to watch, about an hour a piece. If you can not sit through that, don't waste your time. Three on campus exams, one extra credit paper (you have to elect to do it in the beginning of the course), and he curves generously."
0,I really have been enjoying his class so far. He is interesting in his lectures and very devoted to what he teaches. There are only 3 exams and an optional extra credit paper
1,Every online student's nightmare: testing center exams. Three 50-question multiple choice exams. HUGE curves -- I made a low D on my first exam and it was curved up to a B-. He DOES test from his lectures AND the textbook. Finished the class with a B+ and was grateful for it.
1,"His lectures are not as boring as everyone says! Watch 7A - it's funny. He knows so much stuff that it's difficult to put together exams. He grades on a generous curve. If you're not really interested in Clinical or if you have trouble with online classes, don't take him."
1,"I took this class on a DVD, and I didn't even watch all his lectures because they're really monotone and a little boring. I'm going ok in the class, but yes, you don't have hardly any contact with Dr. Sheridan, only his TA. He is really smart though and you can tell he knows his stuff."
0,"I took the online summer course and if you don't have time to watch ALL lectures and type them, do not take this class. Use the book as a reference but watch ALL lectures, type/write them out, study and memorize them, and be able to understand what he is talking about. There were only 3 exams and will ask specific questions from lectures."
-1,His class was exremely hard. He was out of the state most of the time. His grading was extremely unfair. His assistant took care of most of his work. My class was on tape so I never met him and I do not recommend his class at all.
-1,"Do not take on TAPE. You will fall asleep. He was out of state for most of the class so I think the TA (who was awful) made up ALL of the tests. Almost nothing covered in ""lecture"" was on test. Terrible experience"

-1,"Actually took him for calculus 1 at texas a&m corpus christi. Never has he covered the concept at all. He kist writes down equations on the board, doesnt explain how he does them and doesnt give examples. He has you read the book and come to class to stare at him doing the equations that we dont understand. He's often off topic but funny at moments"
-1,I would not take his class again. He is a very funny guy but he is hard to understand and I did not learn anything in his class. It was a computer class and he hardly knew how to work the computer. He also got off topic a lot. He never seemed to talk about the actual chapter. It is not easy to take notes because he clicks through the sides too fast
0,"I'm sure he's good at something but staying on topic isn't one of them. kind of funny, sticks to the book and book slideshows and has his TA's teach the class for half the semester. I did get an A but I did my learning at home not really in class. I suggest this as an easy class with only one HTML project and one Excel project."
1,"Show up to class, take notes, and study the notes outside class and you will do fine. Very enjoyable to talk with. ""Work for me, I love you"" - Talking to a projector screen that won't roll up."
0,"The professor is pretty good. Exams were almost identical to the quizzes you had beforehand, so studying those helps you easily achieve a low B or high C on the exam. Labs were relatively easy, but you usually need the book or a friend's help to complete them. The professor is helpful if you encounter any issues. I came out with a B+ even though I didn't know much during the quizzes, but I did okay on homework. The labs really saved me."
0,"I really enjoyed working with him. Yes, you must understand you are a student and he is a teacher. He gave easy grades as long as you tried. This is a programming course though and you will be doing a bit of programming on your own so don't join if you don't want to learn basic programming. He is also sometimes funny."
1,"The professor is a funny person. You will enjoy their silly quotes. The class has a basic setup with quizzes, labs, and homework about once a week. When I needed help with homework, I went to their office with as much as I could figure out, and they helped me make it work. The professor is friendly, although classes can be a little boring until they say something really random. ""My coffee has gone cold, I HATE YOU GUYS!"""
1,"Sometimes can be confusing, but the course material was rather difficult. Main complaint is that he pulls up ore-concocted notes and references them on the screen. He expects you to do a lot of outside class work learning the material as well. Will gladly help if you have questions though, and made the classroom experience very enjoyable."
1,"The professor, an Indian with a great sense of humor, is quite good. He rarely relies on the textbook and expects students to put in effort outside of class. His unique quotes and accent add to the experience. ""It is not difficult!"" and ""Do you get me, guys?"" are phrases that stick with you. I can no longer create a truth table without hearing his voice saying ""zero-one, zero-one..."" inside my head."
-1,"Before posting this, I read through other ratings and was surprised at the amount of high marks given. I learned nothing from this class and did not find the professor helpful at all."
1,"AWESOME PROF. makes topics fun and inspires you to take an active part in the lecture, plus has some of the best quotes"
1,"The professor adds a touch of ridiculousness to his lectures, making them entertaining. His explanations are incredibly thorough, ensuring a deep understanding of the material. Sometimes the homework assignments may initially seem confusing, but they are actually manageable. The professor often says amusing phrases like ""It must be elegant,"" ""Don't hate me,"" ""Can I take a drink of my coffee,"" ""This hat is the culprit,"" and ""GUYS! Are you with me?"""
-1,not a good professor.
1,"The professor is known for his honesty and impartiality. He is highly regarded as one of the most unbiased teachers in the university, consistently providing fair grades to students. I greatly appreciate this quality in him. However, it is important to note that the following statement may not be entirely true. Nevertheless, overall, he is an excellent professor."
1,"The professor emphasizes strictly following the book without seeking additional knowledge from other sources, as deviating from it may result in a deduction of marks. Additionally, he expects all students to produce identical homework assignments, which simplifies the work for the teaching assistants. At times, I find myself questioning the purpose of the TA's role and their contribution in the course."
1,"good teacher, has accent but still able to understand. simply attending class isn't enough to do great on tests. Ended up with a B in the class for only studying before tests and obviously doing average work on homework and labs (which aren't bad either), homework was generally quick and easy. <1-2 hours a week of actual homework."
1,"His sense of humor is great and there's a good chance that you'll come out of this class with some important life lessons in addition to the course material. It took me two classes with him to realize that HE'S NOT BEING CONDESCENDING, he genuinely cares and wants you to do well. Go to class, do the homework, and remember - ""It's not hard!"""
1,TAs tought class mano tone and dificult to understand. lecturs sounded very scripted and not nateral/ conversational. very easy grader class was a brese
1,"The professor demonstrates fairness in teaching methods, while also demanding a high level of performance from students. Although their English proficiency may not be perfect, it's important to recognize that any unintended condescension is a result of language differences. It is essential to appreciate their genuine concern for student progress and not harbor any ill feelings towards them. During exams and quizzes, don't hesitate to seek clarification on confusing questions. To excel in the class, be prepared to invest significant effort and dedication."
-1,Can't understand a thing in his class. Clearly not a very good professor. Avoid if possible
-1,Wonder how on earth did my grades was graded? Definitely not a fair grader... Class was pretty ok but not clear in the subjects materials... even worse in lab assignments....
1,"The professor demonstrates a profound understanding of the subject matter and sets high expectations for students. However, they acknowledge and value the efforts of diligent individuals. It is crucial to actively immerse oneself in the course material and strive for a comprehensive grasp of the concepts. While the content may be intellectually challenging, a genuine interest and dedicated approach can facilitate comprehension. Although solutions may be provided, students are encouraged to independently explore and discover them. This course provides invaluable insights into professional practices and methodologies under the guidance of a knowledgeable professor."
0,"questions will be very confusing, sometimes hard as well. so do not expect easy A or B.You must be well prepared in order to pass the exam.Get ready for lotta homeworks and quizes. Good luck.Think before you go. Sometimes professor makes a class fun though."
-1,he is ok
-1,VERY Partial
-1,don't know how to teach
1,"By far best teacher in CSCI department, probably at SCSU. Jha is too good to teach low life 169 scum. Get a job you hippies. Jha could teach a monkey with mid intelligence to wire a seven segment display. If you can't learn from him, you should change to human relations."
-1,"Stupids always feel others are stupid. Look at his smile, do not look at your grade. He laughs like a donkey."
-1,"Ask students to go to help for help, but when you do. He makes you feel stupid for going. TA was nice. He does not give review for any of his exams. The only good thing about his class, was that all his past 3 years' HW, QUIZ, and Exams are online. :)"
1,"Very easy class with him. I thought he was a great teacher, very funny and always helpful in answering questions. Always makes sure people understand what he's talking about. I would reccommend taking this teacher... I'd take him again if I have a choice."
-1,I'm not sure what this professor gets paid for. He only showed up on the first day of class really and had his absymbal TA's teach our class. It made for a boring class where nothing was learned. He should try doing his job.
-1,"He was at class the first day and he had is TAs teach the class. I knew more about basic computers then them, and one time i had to help them turn on the printer! What D-Bag! the class was easy though, i never went but for tests, and i got a C."
-1,"I also feel if this is the best teacher in the computer science department, I'm glad I'm not a CS major."
-1,"Yeh, there was nothing to learn and class was easy!!"
1,"The Professor keeps the class interested and makes sure everyone understands the subject. Sometimes gets lazy, but you can use this to your advantage! We may not have learned much, but overall was an easy class."
1,Good Professor. Professor has an interesting sense of humor.
-1,"During the first week of my C++ class, the substitute instructor was not effective in conveying the material, leaving me feeling confused and lost. However, when Jie Hu took over the teaching responsibilities, there was a notable improvement in my understanding of the subject. It is clear that this particular individual is not skilled in teaching, as echoed by the feedback of other students."
-1,"If this individual is considered the top professor in the computer science department, I am relieved that I did not choose computer science as my major. Their teaching style lacks a logical and comprehensible approach, as they tend to jump from one idea to another without proper explanation or coherence."
1,"very knowledgable but, very frustrated in his career. besides, great guy overall. very nice sense of humor and wow"
1,"great teacher, funny as hell, but as in all classes you have to do the work to get the grade."
1,great teacher
-1,learned nothing
1,"Awesome professor, he will explain the material until you get it. SOmetimes it's hars, but he will do everything for you to understand it. His humor is awesome, and he will encourage you to ask questions at all times. Take it if you can.The best professor"
1,"Very good at explaining things, always encourages students to ask questions, and extremely knowledgable. Not to mention super hilarious at times. Just remeber, ""It is not difficult!"""
1,Professor is incredibly knowledgeable in the subject and actively encourages students to ask questions in class or seek assistance during office hours. His unique sense of humor adds an enjoyable and engaging atmosphere to the class. I highly recommend taking a course with him if you have the opportunity.
1,The greatest teacher I have ever had. He's brilliant and funny. You will learn a lot and you have to work for an A. Do whatever you can to take a class with him.
1,The best professor that we have in stcloud state. excellent command of the subject
1,Highest recommendations. His accent and integrity will keep you awake.
1,"great teacher, go to class and do HW, you'll do good."
